English's 7th season was every bit as good. After a breakout 2022, English went to another level in 2023, averaging 119 and, more importantly, played every game of the season. Both Gawn and Grundy improved their average in the year following their first season averaging 110+ and we typically see greater consistency in the top ruck tier than the other positions. That's why it's historically proved beneficial to pay up in the ruck (#setandforget) as they often back it up. However, with Gawn, Grundy and Xerri all stepping into solo roles this season, it's a rare year that we have multiple appealing ruck options with significant price upside. I think I'd pass on English to start the season and hope he comes in cheaper when it comes to upgrade season, at the very least the jump from one of the other options will be far less.","No reason why he won't lead the comp in scoring again, although lingering concussion issues and Gawndy freed means there might be better value in the ruck this year",,,,1,1,2,2,1,138,21,0,158,76, 11 / 23, 15 / 23, 1 / 23, 0 / 23, 0 / 23,82,84,84.54545455,85.33333333,84,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,118.6956522,0,119,0,118.2222222,1,124.8,-6,,,118.6956522,0,118.6956522,118.6956522,100.125,78.68181818,90.97222222,78.45,67.4,35,10,1,24,112,62,98,143,242,138.2278481,138.2278481,119.1078067,95.58255108,103.8363982,93.61575179,83.83084577,53.03030303,0,18.57065217,21.44318182,-12.29040404,12.52222222,11.05,32.4,,11.2173913,7.913043478,6.304347826,31.17391304,0.695652174,4.347826087,12.15036232,7.685688406,5.777173913,28.89945652,0.514492754,4.569746377

However, this all changed midway through 2020 when he went on a rampage to average 124 points in the second half of the season. He spent the majority of his time playing as an inside midfielder rather than splitting his time forward as he did earlier in his career. However, Bevo being Bevo, the Bont returned to the fwd/mid split. However, Dunkley leaving opened up a full-time midfield role for Bont in 2023, and he did not disappoint. A 117 average meant that he was the number one mid in Fantasy. It was his tackle numbers (7.5 per game) that were the surprise, and he looked a man amongst boys at times. At 28, he's in his peak and will continue to be one of the best players in the comp, in real life and in Fantasy. No winning team has started with a player priced over 116 since 2018, so while he could average the 123 he did post-bye in 2020 and 2023, I'll back the history and target a cheaper player with better upside as my M1.","Rare the number one player IRL is the number one mid in Fantasy which was the case last year, however it's rarer for the number one mid to go back-to-back",,,,1,1,3,3,1,136,16,0,158,86, 8 / 23, 17 / 23, 1 / 23, 0 / 23, 0 / 23,84,76,82.25,82.70588235,76,,,0,0,0,0.529411765,0,,,116.9565217,0,113.2857143,4,122.6666667,-6,120.8,-4,,,116.9565217,0,116.9565217,116.9565217,102.5909091,105.7307692,104.8611111,103.173913,92.2,100.2,13,2,17,20,23,24,40,23,137.807377,137.807377,121.1486849,125.3533972,121.617268,122.826087,106.9605568,116.1066049,0,14.36561265,-3.13986014,0.86965812,1.687198068,10.97391304,-8,1.8,16.08695652,11.56521739,4.391304348,0.043478261,0.826086957,7.47826087,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

We all knew he had the potential - in averaging 115 in 2021 for the 13 games with more than 50% CBAs - however given the typical low scoring Richmond system, his 125 average pre-bye still far exceeded my expectations. He came back to earth post-bye, averaging 93, which netted a 112 full-season average. The optimist says he could be underpriced if he replicates the 125. That same optimist could see a change in coach from one whose style wasn't conducive to high Fantasy scoring mean more points on offer for the Tigers.

He was rumoured to have been dealing with a knee issue and regressed behind Serong as Freo's best mid, but he still managed to average 110. This was due to his elite mix of tackling in the inside and then bobbing up for marks on the outside, the perfect inside/outside game for Fantasy. My personal opinion is he needs to work more on his inside game (33% contested rate compared to 45% for the top eight mids, four clearances compared to 6) and less on the cheap marks. As a Fantasy coach I can't complain and with Serong now the tag threat, he should continue to be a 110+ mid. 27 Feb Update: With Fyfe looking great inside and Young still staying there, could we see a slight dent into Brayshaw's CBAs? It might only be to 70%, but at that top price, I think I'd want to be sure it will remain the 80% he finished 2023 with.","Back-to-back 110 seasons, despite having a down year and a knee issue",,,,8,7,7,8,4,129,-10,-3,157,72, 6 / 23, 17 / 23, 1 / 23, 0 / 23, 0 / 23,76,81,80.5,80.64705882,81,,,0,0,0,0,0,,,110.3478261,0,110.7272727,-1,110,0,116.4,-6,,,110.3478261,0,113.3333333,110.3478261,113.3333333,104.25,95.51470588,69.54545455,66.8,,26,9,2,22,45,143,147,,142.7072403,133.5086796,142.7072403,132.2969543,126.7564403,97.95134443,100.4511278,,-2.985507246,-2.985507246,9.083333333,8.735294118,25.96925134,2.745454545,,,14,15.17391304,3.782608696,0,0.47826087,6.217391304,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

However, he proved a poor starting selection in 2023, despite still averaging 109, which shows you need a lot to go right when paying up for premiums in Fantasy. Laird feasted in 2022 when he was the main man in the middle, alongside fellow inside bulls of Ben Keays, Matt Crouch, Sam Berry, Harry Schoenberg and Rory Sloane. The Crows played a very contested game-style and the tackling and clearance machine feasted. There was a clear shift in style and personnel to start 2023, with the more direct Jordan Dawson moving in and stints from Josh Rachele and Jake Soligo. Laird got left behind at times and averaged 107 pre-bye. However, they went back to their old crew to finish the year and Laird went back to the 114 average.

It's no question midfielders rely on CBAs for scoring and Serong hit the 80%+ mark in both CBAs and TOG, the combo we see with the top Fantasy mids. With the role upside exhausted, he'll need to rely on natural development to improve again, something that should happen given he's still just 23. His outside game (3.3 marks per game v top eight mids of 4.3) is an area of improvement that should come with another pre-season under his belt.

We all knew Dunkley could score as well as any player in Fantasy. He averaged 118 in the last five games of 2018, 127 in the last half of 2019 and 116 in the first half of 2021. However, he just never put together a full season, largely due to Bevo taking him out of the midfield. He managed to match his career high of 110 in 2022 from just 51% CBAs, which is the clearly the lowest of any player with a 110 average. The move to the Lions was meant to bring 80% CBAs and 110+ scoring. The CBAs were there, however the scoring was not, averaging 104 for the season. It was evident the Bulldogs system was far more conducive to high Fantasy points, but he also appeared to play a more defensive role in the midfield. He also had a calf issue that hampered him at times. He's lost his forward status which has always been his big appeal, but I have a feeling he returns to a 110+ average in his second season in the Lions' system.","Didn't deliver the big scoring expected of him, but the role was there and I think it will come in 2024",,,,16,16,18,37,8,123,-7,-6,172,61, 4 / 24, 12 / 24, 9 / 24, 1 / 24, 0 / 24,75,84,79.5,80.5,78.77777778,84,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,104.3809524,0,106.4545455,-2,102.1,2,91.8,12,90.66666667,13,102.6666667,1,110.0434783,102.6666667,109.826087,89.26666667,96.5625,110.0434783,95.8,63,38,20,6,51,39,8,31,152,131.2889813,127.2727273,131.2889813,113.4745763,120.2022822,130.2289684,117.4019608,80.56265985,-7.376811594,-7.15942029,20.55942029,-7.295833333,-13.48097826,14.24347826,32.8,-20.8,10.875,13.375,5,0,0.083333333,6.875,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

It certainly helped that Williams was out for the season and Docherty spent more time in the midfield, however he still had Saad being the main free runner back there and Newman was forced to play defensive matchups most weeks. This made his breakout season at age 30 even more impressive. It's hard to go against him based on what he produced, but with Williams returning and Docherty likely to spend more time down back, I think he'll score more in line with where he was pre-bye (89) rather than the 109 post.","The second-best defender in the game to finish 2023, but Williams returning and Doch potentially down there, I can't see him replicating it",,,,5,5,11,1,5,117,20,0,164,27, 6 / 24, 10 / 24, 11 / 24, 4 / 24, 1 / 24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,9,23.83333333,24.5,11.27272727,10.75,9,97.95238095,0,89.41666667,9,109.3333333,-11,121.4,-23,97.66666667,0,101,-3,97.91666667,97.91666667,77.73684211,86.35714286,36.25,93.35,74.2,84,83,33,120,64,376,53,105,64,111.7982873,111.7982873,95.90909091,106.7078553,80.55555556,111.2634088,101.2278308,110.0917431,0,20.17982456,-8.620300752,50.10714286,-57.1,19.15,-9.8,,15.66666667,7.708333333,7.625,0,0.125,3.541666667,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He certainly had excuses, breaking his collarbone after Round 2 and arguably returning too early, missing just three weeks. He scored under 90 in seven of his next 10. Adding to the AC joint, he also tweaked his MCL and continued to play and was also rumoured to have a sore Achillies. He looked more like the Steele of old to finish the season, averaging 125 from Round 17 to 20, but he finished the season with a 59, 67 and 91 in his last 4. There is no question his 2023 season (and 2024 price) was impacted by injury. The issue was more how he looked when healthy. The Saints are trying to inject speed into their play and Steele looked a step off the pace at times. I think the days of him being the number one Fantasy scorer in the comp are over, but with his high tackle rate, an injury free season should see him at least go at 107+ which would be enough for him to be a good starting pick.","Plenty of excuses after 3x110+ seasons in a row, the game is a bit quicker now but if injury free should push back towards that 110 mark",,,,24,23,24,43,1,117,-11,-23,146,59, 4 / 21, 11 / 21, 9 / 21, 3 / 21, 0 / 21,96,73,82.5,81.63636364,70,76.33333333,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,97.85,0,98.125,0,97.66666667,0,89.6,8,114,-16,98.61904762,-1,121.3636364,98.61904762,110.4444444,121.3636364,113.4210526,96.15,94.4,92.8,6,30,4,2,8,43,35,36,142.7807487,124.0862792,129.7650131,142.7807487,132.6970443,114.0569395,118.7421384,122.5891678,-22.74458874,-11.82539683,-10.91919192,7.942583732,17.27105263,1.75,1.6,21.2,10.80952381,12.95238095,4.095238095,0,0.19047619,7.142857143,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

However, with Green's emergence, Coniglio's bounce back and the evergreen Cal Ward being the preferred as the inside mids at the backend of the season, Kelly was pushed to a wing, where he played well but the wing is not conducive to high Fantasy scoring. I still believe he can return to be a 110+ averaging mid if he gets 65%+ CBAs, which he did to average 110+ in 2018, 2019 and the second half of 2021, but I don't believe we will see 65%.

However, his 2023 was everything but linear. The former number four pick started with a bang, 108 and 123 in his first two matches. He was then a late withdrawal in Round 3, returning in Round 4 but was a shadow of the player in the early rounds, not reaching triple figures again until Round 17. It included missed seven games for injury. However, after following a 63 first up from injury, he put up 121 in his next four and five 100+ scores in his six games. He then was a late withdrawal (again) in Round 23, and we didn't see him again. He's an emerging star of the comp and I think we'll see him go to another level again this season. The only thing that I see holding him back is the potential for opposition attention as he's clearly the Roos' best player. Priced at 97, he can easily surpass that by 10 points per game if he avoids the tag.

He had a nice combo of CBAs and KI, joining the likes of Jordan Dawson, Nick Daicos and Harry Sheezel - all Fantasy gems. I doubt he'll be required in the midfield as much in 2023 following the recruits and the young guns emerging, which is a good thing for his Fantasy scoring as his best when playing in defence. Plus, WC primary distributor over the last decade is no longer there. However, I doubt West Coast will be as bad as they were last year, meaning there won't be as much ball back there. So while he comes in as the 7th most expensive defender, I don't think he'll have the consistency to push into the top six in 2024.","Career best 2023 but I expect less to fall on his shoulders in 2024, despite being captain and Hurn retiring",,,,7,8,8,6,8,115,10,0,140,63, 2 / 22, 9 / 22, 9 / 22, 3 / 22, 0 / 22,0,24,5,13.44444444,2.666666667,8,,17,30,29.5,23.88888889,20.77777778,28.66666667,,96.27272727,0,94.83333333,1,98,-2,99.8,-4,,,96.27272727,0,96.27272727,96.27272727,83.55,78.5,86.54411765,66.46666667,68.4,64.8,94,38,90,113,85,170,136,145,113.4440279,113.4440279,102.3270055,92.89940828,99.61069736,79.50558214,81.23515439,82.02531646,0,12.72272727,5.05,-8.044117647,20.07745098,-1.933333333,3.6,11.6,16.59090909,7.227272727,7.590909091,0,0.045454545,2.863636364,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

It was an early concussion in 2022 that held him back and a knee injury on 14 in Round 1 last season. While he always appears underpriced and a top six candidate, he always seems to let us down. It's hard to predict Stewarts' prospects for 2024, given the fact he gets a lot of opposition attention (not ideal for a Fantasy defender) and that he's now over 30 in a team who notoriously rests their older players. However, on the other hand you can get a player capable of a 105+ average in your defence priced at 96. Update: talk of midfield, which is a shock, but then again he attended 15% CBAs in the L5 of 2023.

It started with hamstring tightness in the pre-season and then tore his meniscus in Round 6, seeing him miss the next 10 weeks. On return, he played a less prominent role, averaging 59% CBAs compared to the 80% he averaged in the prior two seasons. It appeared the Suns were looking at the future and the likes of Sam Flanders and Humphrey getting a run in the middle. It was probably the right call given Miller is now 28 and unlikely to be in their starting midfield when they push for a premiership. With a new coach, it's hard to know what role Miller will play in 2024. If he got back to a 75%+ CBA mid, he's the perfect underpriced premium that we can build our starting squad with. If not, he might struggle in a new system that will likely yield less Fantasy points, especially with Flanders, Anderson and Rowell all getting more of the ball. With a Round 3 bye, it might pay to use the first two rounds to assess the role before jumping on in Round 4.","Pushed out of the midfield on return from injury, can certainly bounce back if Hardwick has him in his midfield sights but that's not guaranteed",,,,29,28,35,26,1,115,-10,-26,120,48, 0 / 13, 6 / 13, 4 / 13, 1 / 13, 0 / 13,72,88,,76.83333333,66.5,88,,0,0,,0,0,0,,96.15384615,0,95,1,97.14285714,-1,98.5,-3,,,96.15384615,0,121.952381,96.15384615,109.8181818,121.952381,100.7352941,90.72222222,86,78,5,39,7,1,28,62,60,83,143.714927,117.260788,126.6911379,143.714927,122.2341185,110.7719441,101.8957346,95.94095941,-25.7985348,-13.66433566,-12.13419913,21.21708683,10.0130719,4.722222222,8,-3.6,14.69230769,10.23076923,3.846153846,0,0.307692308,5.230769231,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

However, it still involved an injury, which has been the constant throughout his career. I still think it's crazy that he's younger than Tim English and given he's heading into his age 25 season, he should be at his peak as English was last year. However, the top two rucks of the past have largely been solo rucks who take more than 80% of the contests. With Jackson there, that's unlikely to happen. And surprise, he's had another interrupted pre-season, so we might see another slow start. Despite this, I still think we could see him average over 95 for the first time, but there's not the upside as there is with some of the other solo rucks (Gawn & Grundy).","Primed at 25, unfortunately for him he's not the solo ruck and he's had another interrupted pre-season, otherwise he could challenge the top 2",,,,4,4,3,,4,114,4,0,128,34, 3 / 15, 7 / 15, 5 / 15, 2 / 15, 2 / 15,75,23,79.66666667,83.71428571,64.2,49.5,44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,95.4,0,93.18181818,2,101.5,-7,,,,,101.7692308,-7,95.4,95.4,86.28571429,93.71428571,64.58333333,68.63636364,73.4,83.6,97,41,78,43,200,151,110,65,128.1110116,128.1110116,107.6009501,115.7647059,83.15450644,81.13045347,86.35294118,99.40546968,0,9.114285714,-7.428571429,29.13095238,-4.053030303,-4.763636364,-10.2,,6.333333333,7.466666667,3.4,39.13333333,0.266666667,3.2,12.15036232,7.685688406,5.777173913,28.89945652,0.514492754,4.569746377

More impressively, he was more impactful IRL than his Fantasy scores suggested. He displayed a great balance of inside ball winning ability and tackles with outside run and marks. He will no doubt improve again with another pre-season under his belt. I doubt it will be by enough to be a boom starting squad selection now he's lost his defender status, but I think he'll average over 100 in 2024.

There have been a few factors for the regression. A pre-season syndesmosis injury in 20222 and off-season back surgery in 2023. The worrying part was that it was his back-half of 2023, when he should've been at full fitness and peaking in CBAs at 59%, yet only averaged 79. He won enough of the ball (averaged 28.5 disposals, more than the top eight mids), he just had a low kick-to-handball ratio (0.76 v 1.2 of the top 8) and lacked counting stats of marks and tackles. However, this turned in the finals where he increased his CBAs to 68%, the same level where he averaged 109 in 2021, and averaged 115, winning the Garry Ayres medal for the best player in the finals. Priced at 95, there is no question he's underpriced - he averaged more than that in his second season. A full pre-season for the first time in three years will do wonders. The question is if he can maintain the 105+ level which he needs to at that price. The early bye (Round 2) hurts, but it also means we can see if he maintains the 65%+ CBA number that he did in the finals and then you can jump on with confidence in Round 3.","Injury interrupted pre-seasons twice in a row has seen a regression, but if the finals were any indication, we're about to remember how good Walsh is in 2024",,,,32,25,23,51,9,113,-10,-14,140,53, 4 / 18, 8 / 18, 5 / 18, 2 / 18, 1 / 18,58,39,52.5,53.875,53.6,39,39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,94.6,0,102.3,-7,79.2,16,87,8,114.6666667,-20,100.5882353,-6,108.9545455,97.94444444,103.35,108.9545455,96.69117647,91.90909091,,,41,32,14,13,36,60,,,124.7138398,124.6817539,124.668275,124.7138398,114.4672702,109.4155844,,,-11.01010101,-5.405555556,-5.604545455,12.26336898,4.782085561,,,,12.33333333,16.16666667,3.5,0,0.333333333,4.833333333,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

However, he didn't attend a CBA after his bye last year, and while his scoring wasn't eye-catching (note it included an injured 25), he began to be the primary distributor out of defence for the Tigers. A new coach means roles are uncertain, but with the early bye, I'm not sure you'd want to start Short anyway.

His CBAs reduced from 93% in 2020 to 46%(!) pre-bye in 2023. Not surprisingly, the Gawn/Grundy combo didn't work, and the Dees left Grundy out of the side for much of the second half of the season and all of finals. Again, not surprisingly, we say Gawn returned to be one of the best rucks in the comp, IRL and Fantasy. His season high of 162 came from 91% CBAs. In his three games over 120, he averaged 93% CBAs. In his 12 scores under 90, he averaged 57% CBAs. Grundy is now gone, and Max is back solo. At 32, we won't see him hit the heights of 2020, or possibly even 2021. However, lower estimates have him averaging over 100 which is enough at that price to prove a decent starting option. The early bye isn't ideal, but he does have until Round 6 for his first bye, and he's got too many points and cash to have to wait until then.","His three scores over 120 last season he averaged 93% CBAs, no Grundy, bring it on",,,,6,5,6,4,1,111,-6,-32,162,4, 3 / 22, 6 / 22, 12 / 22, 2 / 22, 1 / 22,91,10,92.66666667,76.66666667,56.58333333,32.5,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,92.1,0,82.3,10,101.9,-10,97.2,-5,107,-15,97.71428571,-6,123.6607143,93.45454545,103.1818182,110.76,123.6607143,111.2857143,108.9,85.8,3,45,15,9,1,5,7,53,133.5841049,115.2466368,116.171955,124.2818671,133.5841049,129.552636,128.1176471,108.3333333,-30.20616883,-9.727272727,-7.578181818,-12.90071429,12.375,2.385714286,23.1,-20.8,10.36363636,6.545454545,4.636363636,25.68181818,0.454545455,2,12.15036232,7.685688406,5.777173913,28.89945652,0.514492754,4.569746377

He looked purely focused on his role which at times meant manning an opposition mid and winning the footy came second. This means his scoring is capped, only six scores over 100 and two over 120.

However, you wouldn't think that after watching him in 2022 and 2023. Even in his good seasons, when he doesn't get the inside role he wants, he looks a shadow of himself. Unfortunately, it was this way for the majority of 2023 - just 36% CBAs after being a 75%+ guy for years. I expected Dunkley would open up an obvious spot in the midfield. However, the Dogs' preferred midfield mix was Libba, Bont and Treloar, with all three averaging over 78% CBAs. It's a very tight midfield rotation at the Dogs and there were multiple games Bevo even used Caleb Daniel inside over Macrae. From the outside, it appears that the Dogs wanted more pace in there and didn't want to sacrifice Bont or Libba, both of whom had terrific seasons. With forward status, his history and the fact he's not even 30, he has to be on your watchlist for 2024. However, I have the feeling we'll see much the same in terms of role for Macrae and we all know what that means. But in a weak forward pool, it will still be enough to be a top forward. Update: Smith out for the year should only help his cause. Although it sounds like Sanders has stepped right into an inside mid spot. I'll still need to see his role in the pre-season.

After back-to-back 109+ seasons possessing the perfect marks/tackle combo we crave in Fantasy, nothing went right in 2023 and he dropped his average by a massive 25 points per game. It started with him forced to play a key defensive role after many of the Swans' key backs went down. His defensive attributes and versatility has always been a burden for him in Fantasy, often shifted to be loose man in defence or to a wing and play behind the ball. But never key defence. He averaged 12% CBAs from Round 4-6, including 0% in Round 5. He averaged 84 in this time. Swans then got some players back and Mills started building in the midfield, with 47% then 63% CBAs in Round 7 and 8, scoring 110 in the latter. He looked back to his 110+ ways. However, he popped a calf in the first minute of Round 9 when on 3, which was a tough break for those who traded in the underpriced mid. He returned in Round 15 when Swans beat WC by 171 and was subbed off just after half time.

He started pretty well, averaging 92 in his first 2, before injuring his MCL in Round 3 when on 52. He missed the next six weeks, before being eased back in, starting as the sub in Round 10 (64% TOG) and 75% TOG in Round 11. He then averaged 104 in his next 3, including a game rucking against the Gawn/Grundy combo and looked to be a top six forward candidate for the run home. However, Cameron missed a week for injury and Mason Cox started to take more of the centre-bounce ruck contests, and had a great impact. So much so that Cox was the Pie's number one ruck throughout the finals, leaving Cameron to attend 33% of the centre bounces during the finals. With McStay out for the season and Cox's influence late in the year, there's a chance we see Cameron spend more time forward in 2024 and now that he's lost his forward status, he doesn't present as a great starting option in Fantasy.",Spent more time forward late in the season with Cox being the main man and we might see more of that in 2024 with McStay down,,,,9,10,8,8,10,103,-7,2,109,52, 0 / 19, 4 / 19, 12 / 19, 5 / 19, 0 / 19,72.5,63,,62.75,58.58333333,54.4,,0,0,,0,0,0,,84,0,82.42857143,2,85.22222222,-1,85.4,-1,74.33333333,10,82.47368421,2,82.47368421,82.47368421,81.91666667,69.27777778,54.125,,27,,184,96,98,177,290,,289,,111.2136267,111.2136267,107.3144105,84.65716225,72.65100671,,57.08245243,,0,0.557017544,12.63888889,15.15277778,27.125,,,,7.315789474,5.789473684,3.421052632,25.78947368,0.263157895,3.210526316,12.15036232,7.685688406,5.777173913,28.89945652,0.514492754,4.569746377

Despite putting up big numbers in the reserves, it appeared the Crows had moved on from Crouch. However, he returned to the team in Round 16 and played the rest of the season. He averaged 6.4 clearances a game and many thought he played career best football - as previously he's been criticised for being just an accumulator and getting cheap footy. Us Fantasy folk like cheap footy, and his 2.6 marks per game meant that he didn't average 100 in this time, despite having a big impact on games (averaged 108 SuperCoach points in that time). I was shocked to see he's still only 28, so there's no reason why the Crows should be moving past him if he continues to play the inside role, he did last year. I think his 110+ days are over now that he's playing a very team-first role to stay in the side, but priced at 81, a mid-90s average might be all he needs to be decent starting pick, lets see if he's in there in the pre-season games. 10 Feb Update: Sounds like he's a first choice midfielder, I've bumped him up a bit and getting pretty keen.","Former stud got back in the team to finish 2023, his low K:H ratio and lack of marks means his glory Fantasy days are over but at that price he should smash IF he's in the team",,,,56,41,12,21,7,100,-19,-30,120,40, 0 / 7, 4 / 7, 3 / 7, 1 / 7, 1 / 7,62,38,,68.25,65,38,38,0,0,,0,0,0,0,89.28571429,-8,40,41,97.5,-17,100.6,-20,,,97.5,-17,110.78125,89.28571429,87.90909091,,110.78125,106.1578947,104.9,108.4,37,66,69,,12,13,14,11,143.7550689,131.302521,123.974359,,143.7550689,140.7929638,138.3905013,140.7792208,-21.49553571,1.376623377,-22.87215909,,4.623355263,1.257894737,-3.5,13.9,7.857142857,18.85714286,2.571428571,0,0.285714286,5,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

He's battled with injury (a heart issue in 2022 and off-season knee surgery last season), but the main cause of his demise has been the emergence of the young stars Butters and Rozee. Add in Horne-Francis and there's been a clear shift to the new young mids at Port, with Wines' CBAs dropping to 42% post-bye (was 74% in his Brownlow year). It may appear that 2021 was an outlier, but even outside of that, Wines was always a 90s guy. He's still less than 30, so he shouldn't have fallen off a cliff as he has. Priced at 78, a 95 average is all he needs to be a decent starting pick, especially as he doesn't have an early bye. But to average 90+, he's going to need to get his CBAs back over 65%, which will rely on Willem Drew (also 50% in 2023) losing his role, and given he was just added to the leadership group, might be unlikely.

He battled with hamstring and knee issues in 2021 and a groin issue in 2022, which finally gave way with a complete rupture of his adductor in the final. This delayed his pre-season in 2023, however it was more the role change that hurt his scoring, dropping to just 39% CBAs and used as a pressure forward most of the season. This led to a trade request to the Swans for supposedly more midfield time. The Swans certainly aren't short midfielders, however they do love a tough inside mid and Adams is every bit of that. In a season with a lack of forward options, Adams is exactly what we're looking for - underpriced and potential for a bump in midfield time. The issue is the early bye in Round 5, but I'm prepared to start players with an early bye if they are value, which Adams is. We'll get a proper look at his role in Round 0, and I imagine most of the comp will be on board when they see him right amongst it then. 27 Feb Update: I had some doubts he will see enough time inside, but with Parker joining Mills on the sidelines, they're going to need his big body.

After a breakout season in 2020 which saw him increase his average by 22 points per game, he improved again in 2021 by another seven points to 95 points per game and 105 post-bye. However, he stagnated in 2022, despite increased CBA minutes and then nothing went right in 2023 as he battled with multiple injuries and dropped his average by 20 points per game. A hand injury and two concussions saw him have three games with less than 50% game time, with a 7, 23 and 48. Removing those games he averaged 86, so still a level below his best, but it's hard to hit peak form if you miss regular games for injury. A lot of that might have also been due to how bad the Kangaroos were as scores are generally lower for losing teams. The rise of LDU also took some ball off him and with the depth of their midfield now, he spent some time forward. All of these factors are likely to continue, so I doubt he's going to become the 105+ mid I thought he would be early in his career, but a return to 95 will be enough for him to be a great pick at that price, especially if he gains forward status during the season. I'm on board for now, I just want to confirm his mid/forward split in the pre-season. 23 Feb Update: Not sure if they were just giving the kids a run in the pre-season, but lack of CBAs not encouraging.

However, it didn't pan out, increasing his average by just three points per game and seeing less inside minutes (23% CBAs compared to 38% in his debut season). I certainly didn't expect Nash (69%), Worpel (67%) and Day (63%) to pick up that much of the slack. Of those, Day isn't going anywhere, winning the B&F and showing he's a future star of the comp. Nash came 3rd in the B&F and Mitchell loves him, so his role will likely remain. Newcombe (70%) came second. That leaves Worpel, and my view is that Hawks should move past him and give more minutes to the youngsters in Ward and Mackenzie. I'm not sure that will happen in 2024 though and starting Ward would be a genuine punt. The breakout will come at one point though, whether this year or next, so keep him on your radar.

He started as sub in Round 10 scoring 39 and then was subbed off in Round 11 with concussion on 25. He returned as a sub for two games, scoring 27 and 19, before finishing the season playing his typical inside role at the Blues, averaging 94 in the L5. He's pretty important to their structure and often takes the opposition's best mid, so I expect him to stay at over 65% CBAs in 2024 despite their star-studded midfield. He's proven to be capable of 90+ in this role, and priced at 74, a 90+ average would make him a decent mid-priced selection to start the season.

The second-year player was in genuine rising star conversations in a field which saw two of the best rookies of all time. He did it in a different manner, playing as a medium sized forward, averaging just 15 disposals, but more than half of them contested with over a goal a game. He was used as an inside mid at times in his debut season and as a second ruck last year, which obviously aided his scoring. With Jack Hayes set to return, I doubt we'll see Owens in that second ruck role. So unless we see him back playing some inside mid again, it's hard to see him improving on last year. That is hard to say as typically players take a leap in their third season and Owens is better than your average third year player, but I think we can rule him out if he remains as a forward in the pre-season matches.","Serious talent who does it in an unconventional way, might lose his second ruck minutes to Hayes so unless he turns into an inside mid, where he has been used before, it's hard to see improvement in year 3",,,,25,26,35,56,26,92,11,0,115,36, 0 / 23, 2 / 23, 18 / 23, 11 / 23, 1 / 23,3,10,,3.5,18.72222222,21.09090909,10,0,0,,0,0,0,0,73.86363636,0,78,-4,70.41666667,4,66.8,7,69,5,75.36363636,-1,73.65217391,73.65217391,52.85714286,,,,,,259,162,364,,,,,,89.20484466,89.20484466,75.97535934,,,,,,0,20.79503106,,,,,,,8.130434783,6.913043478,3.608695652,2.130434783,1.130434783,3.782608696,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

He's since split his time between the middle and forward, but Ross Lyon wasn't a fan and played him as a forward, averaging just 22% CBAs post-bye and 7% in the L5. He scored pretty well considering, averaging 76 and 87 in those splits. He now finds himself at the Dons and their midfield is pretty one-paced. They've used Jake Stringer in there in the past to add some forward-half damage but he's past it now, and I think there's an opportunity for Gresham to see some time in there. We have seen Gresham in a consistent midfield role in 2022, however he underperformed from a scoring point of view, averaging 84 points from 60% CBAs.

He returned to play a shutdown role on Charlie Cameron in Round 3 and that was his ticket back to defence. He averaged 87 in his next 6, with three scores over 90, and looked like he was back. However, a significant hamstring injury in Round 10 saw him miss nine weeks. He returned with an 84 but only played one more before an ankle injury finished his season.

However, Kinglsey decided to put him back to the forward-line to start the season, and he averaged 60 through eight rounds. The Giants had just two wins and needed to change something up. It was Round 9 where Himmelberg was moved back to defence, however it ended early, out with concussion in the first quarter. So by the time he returned in Round 12, he had an average of 56. From there, he remained in defence and averaged 86. The 98 from 2022 was always going to be a reach, given the more direct style played under Kingsley and that Whitfield and Ash were both used in defence in 2023, so Himmelberg had to share the load. It's been said that the Giants are going to settle Himmelberg as a defender in 2024, which is great news for his Fantasy prospects and means he's 15+ points under-priced. However, the early bye in Round 3 means it's hard to do, but he's someone to keep an eye on as an early upgrade.","Didn't hit the heights he did post-bye in 2022 (110), but averaged 86 when moved to defence in 2023 and said to be staying there in 2024",,,,45,51,59,28,32,91,-3,-8,114,27, 0 / 25, 2 / 25, 21 / 25, 10 / 25, 1 / 25,0,0,,0,7.428571429,6.3,0,50,8,,36,21.28571429,10.3,8,72.31818182,0,62.69230769,9,86.22222222,-14,83.6,-12,63.66666667,8,73.125,-1,80.04545455,71.28,80.04545455,62.66666667,55.9375,58.2,59.8,50.4,200,186,109,234,270,229,189,210,88.22645291,88.1741712,88.22645291,68.67579909,65.04360465,65.61443067,69.6969697,61.91646192,-8.765454545,-8.765454545,17.37878788,6.729166667,-2.2625,-1.6,9.4,-0.9,11.64,6.6,4.84,0.84,0.48,1.76,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He averaged 47% CBAs for the first six rounds of the season and gave the Crows a nice injection of pace in the middle. In that time, he averaged 92 points. Surprisingly, he averaged just 12% CBAs for the rest of the season and 64 Fantasy points. They preferred Rory Sloane, Ben Keays and later Matt Crouch in there ahead of him. I've said before the Crows' midfield is a little one-paced, especially a few years ago when they were running with Laird, Crouch, Berry, Schoenberg and Sloane. Dawson's move in there last year proved a masterstroke and he provided the point of difference, plus they look to have moved on from Berry and Schoenberg.

He's obviously impressed as he debuted in Round 1 and managed to play 40 games in his first two seasons. So far, he's been limited to a small forward role. I expected him to see some midfield time last season following the departures of Mitchell and JOM, however it never eventuated. He showed great improvement over the year, despite the limited role, averaging 65 pre-bye, 77 post and 87 in his L5. In a year that's short on forwards, an 87 average for a forward priced at 71 would prove a great starting pick. He can obviously score, getting 37 touches and 126 points in his one VFL game last year. However, I doubt he can average 87 across a full season if he remains as a pure forward. CBAs in the pre-season matches are the key, if 40+, I think I'd start him, but I'd need to see some level of centre bounce attendance.","A buzz name in the pre-season due to weak forwards, scoring at lower level, L5 of 87 and natural development",,,,36,37,23,12,37,89,8,0,104,24, 0 / 21, 1 / 21, 18 / 21, 8 / 21, 2 / 21,0,0,,0,2.833333333,2.125,12,0,0,,0,0,0,0,70.71428571,0,65.18181818,6,76.8,-6,86.6,-16,,,73,-2,70.71428571,70.71428571,56.10526316,,,,,,288,191,317,,,,,,93.80922299,93.80922299,75.38896747,,,,,,0,14.60902256,,,,,,,9.952380952,7.333333333,4,0,0.571428571,2.571428571,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

He arrived at Geelong, who despite being the reigning premiers, they weren't super deep in the mids. He got off to a great start and was very impressive in both pre-season games with a clear inside mid role. He then started well in Round 1, scoring 29 at QT, but was then pushed to a wing after Tom Stewart was subbed off. He played 64% TOG that night, then 62% in R2 and 58% R3, none of them sub-impacted games, and then was dropped in R4. This was the story of his season, tastes of inside minutes with 49% CBAs but just 63% TOG. He scored 111 in the VFL game, making it six career VFL games over 100 out of 10, so I think he has the ability. I also think Geelong need to buy into their rebuild and give players like Bruhn more opportunity.

He's been a solid Fantasy contributor in the past, averaging 74 in 2022, 80 in 2021 and 94 in 2019. So when he arrived at the Dogs with forward status, he gained immediate interest. However, under the AFL Fantasy pricing method, if a player plays less than 10 matches, they are priced at a discount to the higher of their prior two seasons, which for Harmes is the 74 in 2022. Therefore, he's not as cheap as he is in SuperCoach, and while he'll stay on the radar as we know he can score well enough in the right role, I doubt he'll be relevant in Fantasy this year. 23 Feb Update: The inside mid role appears real and he's had a great pre-season. Maybe an 80 average is enough in the forward line this season which is certainly achievable in the high-scoring Dogs' system.

He started in the opening centre bounce of 2023, however injured his hamstring in the opening minutes on 2, forcing him to miss the next four weeks. He returned in Round 6 and had 79% CBAs, so he was obviously in Kingsley's plans to play as a midfielder. However, he moved back to defence after Round 10, seeing CBAs in just one other match for the season. This coincided with Giants getting on a roll, so you'd think he will remain in that role in 2024. He averaged 74 in this time, so while he comes into 2024 with defender status, discounted due to his early injury and 18 points below his career best, it's unlikely he'll improve on his 2023 average if his post-bye role and scoring are anything to go by. 18 Feb Update: Pre-season hamstring injury will see him start slowly.","Returned to defence post-bye when Giants started to roll, so you'd think his wing/midfield days are done along with those 85+ scores",,,,51,55,42,51,16,89,-18,-18,115,2, 0 / 22, 2 / 22, 20 / 22, 10 / 22, 1 / 22,31,6,,15.5,13.55,6.1,6,0,0,,0,0.4,0,0,70.52631579,-1,67.7,2,73.66666667,-4,70.8,-1,67.66666667,2,73.38095238,-3,87.734375,70.13636364,86.5,84.61111111,87.734375,77.05263158,54.7,55.3,141,197,76,74,81,107,220,191,111.1646586,93.62864078,111.1646586,105.3979239,106.6679331,99.55120359,77.58865248,83.15789474,-17.59801136,-16.36363636,1.888888889,-3.123263889,10.68174342,22.35263158,-0.6,,10.18181818,7.454545455,3,0,0.136363636,4.181818182,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He backed that up with a respectable 102 but then the dreaded OP struck, and he's missed more than 50% of games since and struggled with his output. A calf injury just before Round 1 after looking the goods as a midfielder in the pre-season games wasn't the ideal start. He then played two games before Round 11 after dealing with groin issues, averaging just 46. However, he started to find his groove, averaging 93 for the four games to Round 15, before hurting his hip - the trifecta! He went on to play four more games, but was managed throughout, including being used as the sub. All that together left with a 70 average for the season. If he's healthy, he can easily average 90+, whether that's as a defender in the absence of Shannon Hurn or as a mature inside mid. Him being healthy is the big question and a risk that anyone will take who pick him. You need to take risks to succeed in this game and if he has a healthy pre-season and looks good in the matches, then I'm ready to go back again. Update: He's fit (for now), he's full time mid and I'm on board.","Hasn't played more than 12 games in the last four seasons so his body is always a concern, but if fully fit he's still a very good player IRL and Fantasy and all reports he is",,,,54,57,17,87,2,88,-10,-36,98,38, 0 / 10, 0 / 10, 7 / 10, 5 / 10, 1 / 10,54,0,,,21,15.8,0,26,14,,,17,17.2,14,70.1,0,73,-3,67.2,3,59.5,11,,,73.66666667,-4,106.1,70.1,57.4,82.66666667,89,102.0869565,106.1,96,54,199,301,90,72,25,11,31,126.0332797,106.5349544,95.34883721,107.9434168,110.6965174,126.0332797,121.6743119,111.627907,-36,12.7,-25.26666667,-6.333333333,-13.08695652,-4.013043478,10.1,17,11.5,5.9,3.4,0,0.1,3.4,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He showed he has the makings to be a star defender of the future, but injures stopped him from a full breakout. The story was much the same in 2023. He was concussed in Round 1 on 57, forcing him to miss Round 2. He returned to average just 61 in his next nine to the bye, looking a shadow of the player that broke out a year earlier. He was so far out of form that he started as sub post-bye, which is where he scored his 23. After that, he was quoted saying ""I just thought to myself to back myself. That’s when I play my best footy, when I’m just out there, playing freely and playing on instinct"". And he did. He averaged 90 in his last seven matches, which included another injury (eye) when saw him sit off just after half time and miss two more matches. He then went to another level in the finals, averaging 102, including a best on ground performance in the prelim and 22 disposals to half time (over 100) in the GF. While Rich was a non-factor last year, his retirement means that Coleman is now the number one distributor for the Lions, a role which can yield an 85+ average. If it weren't for the Round 2 bye, I'd be prepared to start with him.

He led the comp in tackles per game, which was a great achievement for a 21-year-old in his first full season in the midfield. However, Berry's 17.6 disposals per game was low for a main midfielder and with Laird already offering tackle pressure (number two on the tackle list that year), the Crows looked to add some more speed and dynamic movement in there last season. That meant Berry spent most of the year playing SANFL, with just four games at AFL level after 35 in his first two seasons. Laird and Dawson are locked into the midfield and they opted for Crouch as the third mid to finish 2023. I doubt much will change this season, but hopefully we see more of Berry in 2024. Regardless, he's priced at a discount to his 2022 average, meaning he's priced at 69, so he's not super value even if he does get back into the side.","An 84 in his second season looked like he'd be a future Fantasy stud, but the Crows have gone quicker inside now and even if he gets his chance in 2024, the pricing system doesn't make him a bargain",,,,95,130,133,,52,87,-21,-15,57,36, 0 / 4, 0 / 4, 4 / 4, 4 / 4, 1 / 4,45,71,,,55.5,55.5,38,0,0,,,0,0,0,49.25,20,49.25,20,,,,,,,48.33333333,21,84.33333333,49.25,84.33333333,42.76470588,,,,,172,427,87,413,,,,,116.1438409,76.06177606,116.1438409,59.6390484,,,,,-35.08333333,-35.08333333,41.56862745,,,,,,6.75,3.25,1.5,0,0,4.75,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

He was traded to North in the off-season in a trade that could really unlock his potential. After playing just one of 13 games from Round 8, the small forward came back into the side in Round 21 as a running half-back. He had 32 disposals in that game and remained there for the next 3, before being dropped for finals. Around the trade, Fisher noted that Clarkson earmarked him to play as a running defender at the Roos as they look to add to their run and carry game. We've seen the primary Roo defender rack up Fantasy points in recent years, from Luke McDonald in 2020, Jack Ziebell and Aaron Hall in 2021 and Harry Sheezel last season. With Hall and Ziebell retired and Sheezel a chance to progress into the midfield, Fisher is every chance to land that role. At his price, even the 86 he averaged at the Blues in the role would make him a good mid-priced selection as that's not going to be far behind the F6. Update: That role was there but he's now had two hamstring issues which is a red flag, I am okay taking on an injury risk like Yeo, but interrupted pre-season is another issue. 23 Feb Update: Made some errors and didn't have it all to himself with Sheez and Mckerch back there, but Fisher featured in a HB role in the pre-season game and gathered enough of the ball.

Cumming averaged 91 in 2022 and his breakout 2021, quickly becoming the Giants' number one distributor down back as Leon played Ash on the ball and Whitfield up forward. Kingsley came in and put things straight, with Whitfield and Ash back in defence and later Himmelberg who moved back to finish the season. This pushed Cumming up to a wing, which as we know isn't a good thing for Fantasy scoring. He averaged 65 post-bye and didn't take a kick-in to finish the year. This coincided with the Giants' best form of the year, so I'm not sure there is a spot for Cumming in defence in 2024, at least not the high distribution role he had in 2022.

With Wines, Boak, Butters, Rozee and Drew, I doubted he would see more than this for a team in contention, however he finished with 59% CBAs to be a clear first-choice midfielder. If you're looking at pure disposal stats, you'd say he had a modest season, averaging less than 18 touches per game. However, he finished the year with 16 Brownlow votes, the same as sensation Tom Green. He tore some games apart with his clearance work and penetration inside 50 from stoppages. However, you don't get extra points for that in Fantasy and what he lacked was easy possessions. He has 13 games sub-70 and seven sub-50. He's yet to have a full pre-season, so maybe that explains why he doesn't do much outside of a stoppage. But he's in the Patrick Dangerfield mould, and Danger took four seasons before he averaged over 71. I expect him to add some more disposals to his game this year.

He’s also had a shocking run of injuries, and while he managed 19 matches last season, he missed six weeks in the middle with a knee injury when he was on 3. He was also sub on a few occasions, with four games under 50% TOG. The positive was that he was injected back into the midfielder, with 31% CBAs from his 58% season TOG. The downside is that he lost his defender status, which is what kept him on my radar his whole career.

After getting off to a flyer (26 points in 15% TOG), he did his syndesmosis and missed the next 15 weeks. After a 113 in the VFL, he returned to the senior side again as sole ruck, seeing 84% CBAs for a 110. At that stage, he led all rucks for points per minute, ahead of English and Marshall. He was sole ruck the following week but found things tougher against the Reeves/Meek duo (many did in 2023) and scored 74. However he was never solo again, averaging 43% CBAs for the final six matches sharing with Goldy. Goldy has now been moved on and we should see Xerri solo for 2024. He has the scoring ability and now should have the opportunity and with no early bye like the other value ruck plays (Gawn and Grundy), I'm in favour of Xerri at R2.

After an impressive debut season, Windhager was made to work for his opportunities in his second season. A broken hand in the pre-season match saw him miss Round 1 and then start as the sub in Round 2. He was sub in three of his first six matches before being dropped to the VFL. It's here he showed his scoring power, scoring 98, 157, 91 and 120 in his four matches. This shouldn’t come as a great surprise considering he scored over 110 twice in three games at the level in 2022. He was back in the senior side in Round 13 and didn't miss a game after that. He moved to half-back in Round 17 and played there for the final nine games of the season, averaging 79. Personally I found the move odd as the one knock on him is his kicking, he's certainly better suited inside mid. However, it means he has defender status heading into 2024 and if the inside mid move happens, he could prove one of the value picks of the season. Even if it doesn't there's 20-point upside given what he showed as a defender, but I think you want a tad more than that at that price. 23 Feb Update: Broke his hand early in the pre-season game. Said to be right by Round 1, but now how are we going to know if he's got a midfield role? He was there for the short period prior to the injury which is a good sign, but the risk of the pick has increased now. Might have to be someone we trade into unless we hear/see something positive.","Played a bit of everywhere in his first two seasons and shown above average ability, I'm a believer I just need to see his role in the pre-season",,,,81,86,54,43,86,81,5,1,114,15, 0 / 19, 1 / 19, 16 / 19, 11 / 19, 3 / 19,0,0,,0,17.25,14.45454545,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,63.22222222,0,34.33333333,29,77.66666667,-15,74.8,-12,47,16,70.875,-8,62.36842105,62.36842105,50.64705882,,,,,,388,273,392,,,,,,90.32012195,90.32012195,68.17102138,,,,,,0,11.72136223,,,,,,,8.210526316,7.789473684,3.894736842,0,0.105263158,2.526315789,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He was limited to just four games in his draft year due to hamstring injuries but of those, was best on ground in Round 1 and BOG again in the AFL Academy game. He was on a modified pre-season program and didn't debut until Round 10, but it was one of the better debuts you'll see - 16 touches, six clearances and nine tackles from 63% TOG. He backed it up in Round 13 with 22 touches, six clearances and nine tackles from 70% TOG and 22 touches and seven tackles from 68% in Round 16. However, he was a late out Round 17 and subbed out in Round 18 and then played just the one more game for the year where he again had nine tackles in 55% TOG. In all he finished the season with eight matches at just 60% TOG. He's now had his first full pre-season under his belt which should see him bump up to at least 70% TOG. At the same PPM, he would average 78, which isn't enough. Daicos' 2nd year breakout was another level given he came off a high base but Clayton Oliver and Tim Taranto were at a similar price point where you can afford to wait to see how they look (role, TOG, score) in the early rounds and trade them in if they tick the boxes.

CD_I998260,Jack Bowes,8,Snr,79,85,548000,61,Low,D38,D45,40,12,0,0,"Bowes was a prolific midfielder in juniors, averaging 118 points in the NAB League which saw him be a top 10 pick at the Suns, where he played predominantly in defence. He looked to arrive in 2021, averaging 95 in the first half but has battled with injury ever since. A hamstring injury stopped his breakout in 2021 and then surgery in the pre-season ruled him out for the first four months of 2022. He arrived at Geelong last season and looked to have a mid role in the first pre-season game before a hamstring injury saw him just play a half. After missing Round 1, he played five matches with only one with CBAs, but managed to score 77+ in four of them. He then hurt his calf on 10 and missed the next six weeks. He returned as sub for the next three matches, scoring 21, 54 and nine and then played a full game in defence for a 101. He failed to reach 90 in a game after that, but if you remove the four sub games he averaged 72. He's hard to read as is the Cats, who played him back, wing, on-ball and forward in 2023. If he can settle in a position he might prove a great pick, but he hasn't been reliable so far in his career so it's too risky for me.","Didn't get the mid time we expected after moving to the Cats and even when he did, he didn't catch the eye, but a full pre-season and four sub games means he's underpriced heading into 2024",,,,91,95,55,74,31,79,-5,-20,101,9, 0 / 17, 1 / 17, 16 / 17, 8 / 17, 4 / 17,6,0,,6,9.125,9.375,17.75,0,0,,0,6.375,3.25,0,60.70588235,0,63,-2,59.45454545,2,62.6,-2,,,72.15384615,-11,80.57894737,60.70588235,55.4,80.57894737,79.63235294,71.6,63.9,49.9,197,292,331,101,112,132,165,214,100.9228741,90.13100437,78.24858757,100.9228741,96.35231317,95.72192513,81.71355499,69.20943135,-19.87306502,5.305882353,-25.17894737,0.946594427,8.032352941,7.7,14,,9.176470588,6.176470588,3.882352941,0,0.235294118,2.352941176,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

Sadly, this has been the consistent story for Preuss his entire career and it allowed Briggs to take the number one mantle last season and run with it.

At 28, he should be in his prime and may appear underpriced to what he could produce and an off-season move to the Dees might change things for him. It will be very interesting to see how the Dees use him. On the watch-list for the pre-season and I guess we'll get a proper indication in the opening round.

He was thrown in the deep end playing inside mid for a team who struggled most weeks, but it was a clear sign they have big wraps on the kid. He showed a great tackle ability (5.9 per game, in line with the top eight mids) and contested possession rate (46.4%, above that of the top eight mids), however struggled to win the ball outside the contest (13.7 disposals and 1.5 marks per game). That will come, but I doubt it will see a big spike in his second season. He's in great condition on the training track and I'm looking forward to seeing how he looks in the pre-season games, but out of the second year players, I don't think he's the one that will have the big impact.","Big bodied mid has got even bigger this off-season and could certainly breakout, just not sure he has the outside game to be a worthy Fantasy option just yet",,,,114,113,120,,113,76,,0,96,15, 0 / 17, 0 / 17, 15 / 17, 12 / 17, 1 / 17,54,0,,,41.73333333,38.08333333,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,57.94117647,0,63.38461538,-5,40.25,18,,,,,60.625,-3,57.94117647,57.94117647,,,,,,,438,328,,,,,,,82.98230834,82.98230834,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,5.058823529,8.647058824,1.470588235,0,0.058823529,5.941176471,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

The former Pick 13 averaged 68 in his first season after 35 disposals per game in SANFL Under-18s in his draft year. He's since been in and out of the side and averaged 56 points per game in the last two seasons. He got a bit of a bump in midfield time, which included 29% CBAs post-bye to net a 72 average. He will remain on the radar given he has forward status and talent at junior level, however with another batch of young players coming in at the Roos, it's going to be harder for him in 2024 to get the opportunity.

He didn't play again at AFL level that season, but after a 158 at VFL level, he featured in Round 7 last season for the first time since. He was subbed out on just 18 and went back to the VFL where he scored a 130. He played again at AFL level in Round 10 where he started sub and scored just 8, and also played VFL that week for a 118. So while his career scores at AFL read 28, 18 and 8, he showed at the level below that he had something special. We then finally saw him get a decent run at AFL level, playing four games in a row at 91, despite playing just 64% TOG. He then did his syndesmosis in Round 17 on 46, and he didn't feature again. So on face value, he's priced at 57 (9% discount to his 62 average due to playing seven games) and he averaged 91 if you exclude his sub games and when he was injured and that was from just 64% TOG. The question is if he features in their starting midfield rotation now with Adams and Jordon arriving and Warner set for more time in there. If he does, then he might be the breakout candidate we're chasing. We'll get an idea of role, TOG and scoring in the opening round, but I feel he might be a year away. 27 Feb Update: Now no Parker and no Mills, it is Sheldrick time earlier than expected? It's still a gutsy call to start with him, but Round 0 will tell the story.","Contested bull got his change mid-season and showed he's going to be a Fantasy stud of the future with an insane PPM, the question is if he gets midfield minutes this season",,,,115,105,33,,105,75,34,-5,111,8, 0 / 7, 1 / 7, 5 / 7, 3 / 7, 2 / 7,46,9,,46,26.2,17.66666667,6,0,0,,0,0,0,0,62.42857143,-5,13,44,82.2,-25,,,,,82.2,-25,62.42857143,62.42857143,28,,,,,,387,272,526,,,,,,117.7897574,117.7897574,41.79104478,,,,,,0,34.42857143,,,,,,,7,8.285714286,2.714285714,0,0.428571429,3.428571429,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

He didn't play at AFL level in his first season, however played every game he was healthy for in 2023 in a sign of how highly Freo rate him. He was sub or subbed out on seven occasions, and even the games wasn't he only went over 70% TOG six times. So there is clear upside considering his 57 average game from 57% TOG. He'll eventually be an inside midfielder for Freo and from what he's shown he might be a pretty good one, but with Brayshaw, Serong and Young locked into the inside roles, it's hard to see Johnson increasing the 21% CBA figure he averaged last season, so I doubt we'll see the 30+ point bump we need from him to be a viable starting pick at that price and position.

His numbers at VFL level are getting better, averaging 75 in 2021, 97 in 2022 and then an impressive 111 in last season. He just hasn't had a proper crack at it at AFL level due to the midfield depth at Carlton. He played two matches in 2022 and 10 last year, but was sub for five of them. His PPM rate was pretty good, and he averaged 80 when playing the full game. He's now at the Saints who have been trying to inject speed into their midfield for a few seasons now and I can see him getting regular minutes in there this season.

He was limited to just the three matches last year due to a shoulder injury which means he starts at a discounted price, and he's back fit and there's a bit of buzz coming out of Freo about him. He was always behind Young, Ryan and Clark for distribution in defence, but with Young moving to the midfield, he's moves up one spot on the pecking order. The other talk is that he will fill the wing role left by Henry, but it now seems Sharp will take that which is a good thing for Chapman's scoring. I wouldn't even be surprised if we see him spend some time inside. Regardless, he's easily beat his priced at figure, with lower estimates being 75+. Priced at 55, you probably want him averaging over 80 to be a knockout pick, and I think he's certainly capable of that. 10 Feb Update: Sent for scans after injuring his hamstring in the intra-club. It's his hamstrings that he's had issues with in the past. He had hamstring surgery last season and saw a specialist in Spain in the off-season, so it's a bit more concerning that a regular one. Unless news comes out that it's minor, it's time to find a replacement.","Very impressive on limited exposure and heading into his 4th season, was poised to breakout but a pre-season hamstring injury is a big worry given his history",,,,108,98,70,,53,73,-13,-16,85,24, 0 / 3, 0 / 3, 3 / 3, 1 / 3, 0 / 3,0,0,,,0,0,,0,0,,,0,0,,60.33333333,-5,60.33333333,-5,,,,,,,60.33333333,-5,70.76470588,60.33333333,70.76470588,55.33333333,,,,,287,302,170,310,,,,,85.44034091,85.37735849,85.44034091,66.66666667,,,,,-10.43137255,-10.43137255,15.43137255,,,,,,7.666666667,7.333333333,5,0,0,2,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

He's never been a natural Fantasy player as he's very much in the Dustin Martin mould of too good in real life to worry about tackling or picking up cheap marks. Despite winning two Brownlows and being one of the premier midfielders in the AFL, Fyfe's best Fantasy season average is just 105. He finished 2023 with an average of 49, which is 56 points off his best ever 105. The form drop is both injury related (4 games under 60% TOG in 2024) but also came about from the emergence of the young Freo midfield, meaning Fyfe has been playing more time forward. This time last season, Fyfe was earmarked for a full-time forward role, but that was changed after he struggled in the early rounds and he increased his CBAs as the season went on, before a season ending injury in Round 16. He's back training with the mids this season and while he's going to be behind Serong, Brayshaw and Young for CBA rotations, I see him staying at the 40% mark. I think he can push his scoring up to the 75-80 mark, which actually makes him an okay starting option, particularly if he can get a few 90+ scores early. However, his body, role and output has been too hard to trust in recent years, so there is a lot of risk in the pick. 27 Feb Update: 20 touches in a half of match-sim. There wasn't much opposition and little counting stats (only 40 AF from 20 touches), but he won it contested in a full-time mid role.

He burst back into relevance in his first season at the Roos, which included going over 120 twice and 150 once while playing as a CBA midfielder. He then took a step back in 2022, but finished the season in the backline and while he was found out at times defensively, he provided some run and looked at his best, averaging 86 points in his last five with 28% kick-ins. However, Clarko put him back to the forward-line last season and he managed the lowest average of his career. It sounds like Fisher and McKercher are going to take the half-back roles, and there is no room in the midfield now, so I imagine Stephenson will be used as a forward or wing in 2024, and while it's hard to see him not improving on 2023, I doubt it's going to be anything significant.","As hard to read as any in the game, has had stretches where can could be a top 6, either in defence or inside mid, but played mostly forward under Clarko and that's going to limit his scoring",,,,114,110,142,119,8,72,-17,-31,87,38, 0 / 21, 0 / 21, 21 / 21, 20 / 21, 0 / 21,0,0,,,0.619047619,0.65,,0,0,,,0,0,,53.57142857,0,56.21428571,-2,48.28571429,6,51.66666667,2,,,53.57142857,0,84.78947368,53.57142857,71.3125,84.78947368,59.01785714,80.92857143,64.6,,166,376,166,73,247,85,159,,103.9354839,68.09927361,93.21895425,103.9354839,69.60825611,95.88693297,81.6687737,,-31.21804511,-17.74107143,-13.47697368,25.77161654,-21.91071429,16.32857143,,,6.952380952,3.80952381,3.571428571,0.047619048,1.238095238,1.952380952,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

He played the role pretty well in 2021, averaging 89 highlighted by a 151 and 123 in consecutive weeks. He hasn't hit those heights since though, averaging 65 and 55 from 13 and four games due to an Achilles issue and then a quad strain, after dealing with soft tissue issues in 2022. He played his first game in the VFL in Round 14 and then scored 127 in his second VFL game. That saw him back in the 1s for the first time under Ross, and in the three full games he averaged 48% CBAs which is a great sign. However, an early knee injury finished his season in Round 20. He enters 2024 still less than 30 and priced at 54. He can surpass that by 25 points if he maintains that midfield role. There hasn't been much said of him this pre-season, but he's one I'm keeping an eye on.","Two interrupted seasons after back-to-back 89s, if he can get back to full fitness and play a midfield role, he could prove a sleeper in 2024",,,,122,123,80,128,42,72,-19,-35,79,5, 0 / 4, 0 / 4, 4 / 4, 2 / 4, 1 / 4,32,14,,,39.75,34,14,0,0,,,0,0,0,54.5,-1,,,54.5,-1,5,49,,,71,-17,89.140625,54.5,65.38461538,88.61538462,89.140625,82.76470588,67.8,79.1,135,362,221,53,69,79,141,78,121.6473073,100.4608295,98.03921569,121.6473073,113.8268156,102.0526583,82.98653611,94.16666667,-34.640625,-10.88461538,-23.23076923,-0.525240385,6.375919118,14.96470588,-11.3,21.8,6.5,8.5,2.25,0,0,2.75,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934

A pre-season injury meant he wasn't available to start the season and then was forced to work hard for his spot, despite the Bombers' woes. He played seven VFL matches and had more than 30 touches in two of them. He came in for the final four games of the year and looked okay without being amazing, limited to a forward and wing role with little inside action (15% CBAs). Natural development and a full pre-season should set him up for a second-year breakout, but the Bombers have so many who can run through the inside and I have Hobbs and Caldwell over him in the rotation, so we might see him having to bide his time in lesser roles. A watch for the pre-season given his forward status and ball winning ability, but I haven't got great hopes for him this season.",A meniscus tear last pre-season saw the highly touted topfive draftee have to wait until Round 21 for a debut and VFL and NAB League form suggest he'll be a scorer,,,,117,50,16,67,50,71,,-11,86,43, 0 / 4, 0 / 4, 4 / 4, 3 / 4, 0 / 4,31,18,,,14.75,9.333333333,,0,0,,,0,0,,64.25,-11,,,64.25,-11,64.25,-11,,,64.25,-11,64.25,64.25,,,,,,,364,252,,,,,,,96.61654135,96.61654135,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,8.75,7.5,3.75,0,0.25,2.75,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

He played an important role for the team, playing 22 games at an average of 72. However, the acquisition of Hunter on a wing pushed Jordon out and meant he spent time forward in a bit role, including being sub/subbed off seven times. Remove these sub 51% TOG games and he averaged 67, which is more in line with his first two seasons, however in a lesser role. He showed he's developed as a scorer though, averaging 120 in the VFL. While the Swans' midfield is getting pretty deep, they have lost Stephens on a wing and Mills for the front part of the season. I can see Jordon getting some minutes in the middle and if he does, he's more than capable of a 75+ average and higher if it's inside mid, which as a forward this year makes him a great pick. It's a good and bad thing that he plays Round 1, so we'll have a good look at his role and scoring, but at that price point he's one I'm okay starting with if he can go 75+, despite the Round 5 bye. 27 Feb Update: Parker out only helps his midfield push, even if that means wing.

He was a popular mid-priced pick in 2021 following a change of clubs for more midfield time after averaging 106 in the second half of 2019 in a midfield role. After a string of poor performances, he was banished from the midfield and played in defence. That defence role continued before he badly injured his calf, missing the majority of the season. He then did his ACL in the 2023 pre-season and missed the entire year. He now enters 2024 priced at 49 which is about 30 less than what he can produce in a defensive role and 40 less in a midfield role. Regardless of role, he's significantly underpriced and one of the bargains of the season. The only issue is his Round 2 bye. How much will he have to score in Round 0 for you to pick him? I think 75+ will make it worthwhile, which I expect him to do.","Due for a change of luck and as long as he's healthy, he'll prove one of the bargains of the season",,,,138,,,,,67,-20,-43,,, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,92.45833333,,69.88888889,71.5,82.04545455,92.45833333,86.5,82.9,116,,179,153,104,57,56,69,121.6557018,,96.76923077,97.27891156,109.526699,121.6557018,114.116095,102.9813665,,,-1.611111111,-10.54545455,-10.41287879,5.958333333,3.6,2.9,,,,,,,17.27672318,9.493013661,6.568358066,0,0.245722384,2.669131244

And after 80 from 52% CBAs in R1, it look like he was going to be one of the rookies for the season. However, never went above 30% after that, and despite a 94 in R3, he quickly found himself out of the Hawks' best 22, playing as sub in R5 and dropped after R6. He then played as sub a further three times and played twice in the last eight rounds. His VFL numbers were encouraging in that time, averaging 93 for the season but had two scores 119+. He enters 2024 with forward status and with another pre-season under his belt, will be eying off a spot in the midfield. The issue is, a lot are at the Hawks. But if he happens to be the one to soak up the midfield minutes from Day, who might be missing the start of the season, or Worpel, who I can see missing out, then he might be worth jumping on. Like I've said before with second year breakouts, you can afford to wait a few weeks to see if his role and scoring is sustainable first. 23 Feb Update: CBA role in pre-season.

While his numbers don't look great (55 average in his draft year, 46 in his 14 AFL matches and 26 in the WAFL last year), he's a much better player than that. In his draft year, he scored 115 when returning through the WAFL Reserves in 2022 and had a huge game one for WA in the U18 Champs where he picked up BOG honours, collecting 29 disposals and two goals. He then spent most of his year in the WAFL against tougher opposition, which is why his junior scores are lower than the other first rounders of the draft. He showed some great signs in his debut season in a limited role and TOG. He's dealing with a foot issue this pre-season, so I think it's going to be a slow build, but he might be a player of the future.","Showed spark in his debut season and WC now have a few decent kids coming through, will be more forward than mid in the short term but should be a midfielder in time",,,,156,157,106,99,157,64,,0,73,4, 0 / 14, 0 / 14, 14 / 14, 13 / 14, 2 / 14,58,7,,,35.92857143,34.23076923,5,0,0,,,0,0,0,46.28571429,0,21.75,24,56.1,-10,57.4,-11,,,52.75,-7,46.28571429,46.28571429,,,,,,,543,463,,,,,,,73.05524239,73.05524239,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,6.285714286,7.142857143,2,0,0.285714286,1.714285714,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

In that time, he's put up some massive scores in the VFL, including 125 in his last six matches of 2023. So when the trade was made which saw him move to Port, a team who lost their ruck (Lycett) last year, we all thought he'd be the perfect R2 for us this season. However, shortly after the move, Port also added Soldo who I think is the better ruck. The setup is still worth monitoring in the pre-season just in case they decide to go with Sweet, but with the other options out there (Gawn, Grundy, Xerri), Sweet has lost a lot of his appeal. Update: With Soldo only returning to training from a finger injury, it sounds like Sweet might start the season as Port's R1. He costs a bit more than an ideal R3, but with Gawn and Grundy having an early bye, I'd be prepared to pay up for Sweet as R3 if he's named solo in Round 1.","Mature-aged ruckman who played back-up at the Dogs so a move to Port in the off-season gave hope until Soldo joined him shortly after, but Soldo pre-season injury could open the door",,,,29,,,,,61,-17,-18,,, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61.33333333,,61.33333333,60.8,,,,,403,,257,259,,,,,84.79262673,,84.79262673,80.42328042,,,,,,,0.533333333,,,,,,,,,,,,12.15036232,7.685688406,5.777173913,28.89945652,0.514492754,4.569746377

He hasn’t done a heap at AFL level in his first four seasons, and despite matching his career high 16 matches in 2023, he bottomed out with a 39 average. This was largely due to his four games as sub and when in the team, he spent a lot of time forward. His 114 in the VFL shows he still has it and improved from 104 the year prior. Dunkley and Ashcroft took his midfield minutes last year but with no Ashcroft, could we see DevRob injected back in the middle?

There was no under-age football in his draft year, so we had to rely on his 2019 year where he played as a 17-year-old for Oakleigh Chargers, a team that boasted Matt Rowell, Noah Anderson and Will Phillips in the midfield. Finlay was forced to play mostly across half-forward but showed some great signs and from all reports was more advanced than his (half) brother who by contrast only came good during the second half of his draft year. We saw the similarities in Finlay's debut when he was thrown into the middle for the final quarter and racked up over 10 disposals. He also managed 47 from just 37% TOG when used in the middle in his one game last season when sub. He’s averaged over 90 in the VFL since drafted, so the talent is there. Priced at 34 and with forward status, I think he’s worth considering if he’s named Round 1 as an expensive rookie but with more experience.","Brother-of who has averaged over 90 in the VFL since being drafted, worth spending the extra cash if he gets his chance",,,,197,149,1,131,149,52,-6,-13,47,47, 0 / 1, 0 / 1, 1 / 1, 1 / 1, 1 / 1,24,24,,,24,24,24,0,0,,,0,0,0,47,-13,,,47,-13,47,-13,,,,,47,47,22.5,43.11111111,,,,,532,450,532,409,,,,,127.027027,127.027027,48.91304348,76.6798419,,,,,0,24.5,-20.61111111,,,,,,0,7,0,0,0,8,12.26009709,10.25654605,4.533513709,0,0.974872953,3.181949934

Last season's average included seven scores over 120, thanks to a very high kick-to-handball ratio, highlighted by 31 kicks and one handball in his final game of the year.

It was a quick downfall considering he was a highly rated junior and showed great signs in 2021. He averaged 118 in the WAFL under 18s in his draft year and saw plenty of league action that season. It took a while to get his chance at AFL level, but in his second season he played the last nine matches for an average of 79 (excluding his sub game). Despite this, he was in and out of the side in 2022, never playing more than four games in a row. But in that time, he averaged 112 in the VFL. He didn't play a single AFL game in 2023, and while his VFL average was lower than 2022, he still managed two x 140+ games. Freo picked him up as a SSP and he's been dominating their running all pre-season. There are some flaws in his game so his job security will always be shaky, but there's a wing spot available and if named in Round 1, he should prove a worthy selection.","Elite runner with a second chance at Freo where he could take Henry's wing spot, averaged over 100 at VFL level since being drafted and priced at 31, can prove great value",,,,143,,,,,49,-15,-40,,, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,44.90909091,71,38.125,,,,285,,444,157,371,,,,90.63829787,,69.67559944,90.63829787,58.65384615,,,,,,-26.09090909,32.875,,,,,,,,,,,15.73689065,13.09031209,4.314402174,0.005434783,0.560087286,6.160074934
