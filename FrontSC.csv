English's 7th season was every bit as good. After a breakout 2022, English went to another level in 2023, averaging 128 and, more importantly, played every game of the season. Both Gawn and Grundy improved their average in the year following their first season averaging 125+ and we typically see greater consistency in the top ruck tier than the other positions. That's why it's historically proved beneficial to pay up in the ruck (#setandforget) as they often back it up. However, with Gawn, Grundy and Xerri all stepping into solo roles this season, it's a rare year that we have multiple appealing ruck options with significant price upside.

It's been a trend his career to date and I doubt we'll see him push to the 110+ average required to be a SuperCoach-relevant midfielder.","Great season but lacks the efficiency, marks and tackles to become an uber premium SuperCoach mid and a pre-season hamstring injury doesn't help",,,,23,24,24,11,23,132,16,-1,146,56, 5 / 22, 10 / 22, 5 / 22, 1 / 22, 0 / 22,82,76,80.2,80.7,79.8,76,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,102.7272727,0,100.6153846,2,105.7777778,-3,115.8,-13,,,102.7272727,0,104.24,102.7272727,86.47058824,85.36842105,95.72222222,104.24,91.73913043,,79,37,114,104,66,25,53,,125.1384275,125.1384275,104.7754811,109.5205942,114.1815772,123.21513,109.0833893,,-1.512727273,16.25668449,1.102167183,-10.35380117,-8.517777778,12.50086957,,,28.22727273,61.7919726,47.7641994,5.318181818,4.727272727,5.909090909,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

It certainly helped that Williams was out for the season and Docherty spent more time in the midfield, however he still had Saad being the main free runner back there and Newman was forced to play defensive matchups most weeks. This made his breakout season at age 30 even more impressive. It's hard to go against him based on what he produced, but with Williams returning and Docherty likely to spend more time down back, I think he'll score more in line with where he was pre-bye (92) rather than the 111 post.","The second best defender in the game to finish 2023, but Williams returning and Doch potentially down there, I can't see him replicating it",,,,7,8,17,1,8,129,19,1,144,28, 7 / 24, 14 / 24, 9 / 24, 4 / 24, 1 / 24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,50,9,23.85714286,21.85714286,10.33333333,10,9,100.1904762,0,92,8,111.1111111,-11,125.8,-26,93,7,102.3913043,-2,99.29166667,99.29166667,80.21052632,87.64285714,23.5,96.65,71.90909091,80.1,103,42,153,86,391,45,139,77,115.1966627,113.3682207,98.96103896,108.2965578,52.22222222,115.1966627,98.10244326,104.9803408,0,19.08114035,-7.432330827,64.14285714,-73.15,24.74090909,-8.190909091,,23.375,79.9853188,29.76899026,3.375,3.541666667,7.041666667,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He certainly had excuses, breaking his collarbone after Round 2 and arguably returning too early, missing just three weeks. He scored under 100 in eight of his next 10. Adding to the AC joint, he also tweaked his MCL and continued to play and was also rumoured to have a sore Achillies. He looked more like the Steele of old to finish the season, averaging 128 from Round 17 to 20, but he finished the season with a 57, 81 and 80 in his last 4. There is no question his 2023 season (and 2024 price) was impacted by injury. The issue was more how he looked when healthy. The Saints are trying to inject speed into their play and Steele looked a step off the pace at times. I think the days of him being a top few SuperCoach mid are over, but with an injury free season, he should return to at least 110+ which would be enough for him to be an okay starting pick, but you really need him to go 115 to be a keeper at that price.","Plenty of excuses after 3x110+ seasons in a row, the game is a bit quicker now but if injury free should push back towards that 110+ mark",,,,38,38,35,56,2,124,-13,-31,160,52, 5 / 21, 8 / 21, 9 / 21, 4 / 21, 0 / 21,77,74,83.2,82.25,69.11111111,63.25,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,94.75,0,92.75,2,96.08333333,-1,85.6,9,130,-35,96.42857143,-1,126.4761905,96.42857143,109.7777778,126.4761905,120.5789474,95,94.42857143,91.1,13,57,18,2,6,55,45,44,148.7955182,121.3301378,128.9817232,148.7955182,141.0714286,112.6927639,118.7780773,120.343461,-30.04761905,-13.34920635,-16.6984127,5.897243108,25.57894737,0.571428571,3.328571429,27.3,23.76190476,73.5046888,44.3977334,3.761904762,7.142857143,4.619047619,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

It was a combination of being pushed to a wing on the back of Green's emergence, Coniglio's bounce back and the evergreen Cal Ward being the preferred as the inside mids (CBAs down to 51% from 63%) and a 23 (yes, 23) when Finned.

His 2023 was inconsistent, much like his career to date. The former number four pick started with a bang, 143 and 155 in his first two matches. He was then a late withdrawal in Round 3, returning in Round 4 but was a shadow of the player in the early rounds. He then missed five games for injury. However, after following a 94 first up from injury, he put up 126 in his next 6. He then was a late withdrawal (again) in Round 23 and we didn't see him again. He's an emerging star of the comp and I think we'll see him go to another level again this season. The only thing that I see holding him back is the potential for opposition attention as he's clearly the Roos' best player. Priced at 114, you can't afford him to be too inconsistent as you're picking him to be a top eight lock.

The issue with Neale is that he is clearly Brisbane's most damaging midfielder and teams quickly learnt that if they shut down Neale, they would shut down the Lions.

It started with hamstring tightness in the pre-season and then tore his meniscus in Round 6, seeing him miss the next 10 weeks. On return, he played a less prominent role, averaging 59% CBAs compared to the 80% he averaged in the prior two seasons. It appeared the Suns were looking at the future and the likes of Sam Flanders and Humphrey getting a run in the middle. It was probably the right call given Miller is now 28 and unlikely to be in their starting midfield when they push for a premiership. With a new coach, it's hard to know what role Miller will play in 2024. If he got back to a 75%+ CBA mid, he's the perfect underpriced premium that we can build our starting squad with. If not, he might struggle in a new system that will likely yield less SuperCoach points, especially with Flanders, Anderson and Rowell all getting more of the ball.

Nothing went right in 2022, a broken thumb, sore groins and then an Achilles injury that kept him out of the first practice match and Round 1. The recruitment of Luke Jackson quelled any chance of a bounce back in 2023, however he still managed to average 111 after he returned from injury mid-season. I still think it's crazy that he's younger than Tim English and given he's heading into his age 25 season, he should be at his peak as English was last year. However, the top two rucks of the past have largely been solo rucks who take more than 80% of the contests. With Jackson there, that's unlikely to happen.

There have been a few factors for the regression. A pre-season syndesmosis injury in 20222 and off-season back surgery in 2023. The worrying part was that it was his back-half of 2023, when he should've been at full fitness and peaking in CBAs at 59%, yet only averaged 101. He won enough of the ball (averaged 28.5 disposals, more than the top eight mids), he just had a low kick-to-handball ratio (0.76 v 1.2 of the top 8) and lacked counting stats of marks and tackles. However, this turned in the finals where he increased his CBAs to 68%, the same level where he averaged 117 in 2021, and averaged 122, winning the Garry Ayres medal for the best player in the finals. Priced at 103, there is no question he's underpriced - he nearly averaged that in his second season. A full pre-season for the first time in three years will do wonders. The question is if he can maintain the 115+ level which he needs to at that price. The early bye (Round 2) hurts, but I think he can challenge for a starting spot regardless.","Injury interrupted pre-seasons twice in a row has seen a regression, but if the finals were any indication, we're about to remember how good Walsh is in 2024",,,,22,20,13,45,4,132,-10,-14,134,72, 3 / 18, 12 / 18, 2 / 18, 0 / 18, 1 / 18,58,39,73.33333333,56.16666667,47.5,,39,0,0,0,0,0,,0,103.2,0,104.4,-1,100.8,2,90,13,122,-19,106.1764706,-3,117.0454545,106.3333333,110.95,117.0454545,101.1176471,86.90909091,,,23,27,14,9,51,76,,,135.3606789,135.3606789,133.8359469,133.975026,119.7075209,103.4632035,,,-10.71212121,-4.616666667,-6.095454545,15.92780749,14.20855615,,,,28.5,73.90897414,38.07620554,4.166666667,4.833333333,3.833333333,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

The last two seasons has largely been on the back of sharing the ruck duties, with Luke Jackson in 2022 and then unbelievably with Grundy last year. His CBAs reduced from 93% in 2020 to 46%(!) pre-bye in 2023. Not surprisingly, the Gawn/Grundy combo didn't work and the Dees left Grundy out of the side for much of the second half of the season and all of finals. Again, not surprisingly, we say Gawn returned to be one of the best rucks in the comp, IRL and Fantasy. His season high of 162 came from 91% CBAs. In his six games over 120, he averaged 75% CBAs. In his seven scores under 90, he averaged 59% CBAs. Grundy is now gone and Max is back solo. At 32, we won't see him hit the heights of 2020, or possibly even 2021.

Unfortunately, this didn't result in decent SuperCoach scoring. He plays completely inside with zero spread to get easy possession, highlighted by his 65% contested rate (top eight mids 46%) incredibly low 1.9 marks per game (top eight mids 4.3). He looked purely focused on his role which at times meant manning an opposition mid and winning the footy came second.

However, you wouldn't think that after watching him in 2022 and 2023. Even in his good seasons, when he doesn't get the inside role he wants, he looks a shadow of himself. Unfortunately, it was this way for the majority of 2023 - just 36% CBAs after being a 75%+ guy for years. I expected Dunkley would open up an obvious spot in the midfield. However, the Dogs' preferred midfield mix was Libba, Bont and Treloar, with all three averaging over 78% CBAs. It's a very tight midfield rotation. There were multiple games where Bevo used Caleb Daniel over Macrae. From the outside, it appears that the Dogs wanted more pace in there and didn't want to sacrifice Bont or Libba, both of whom had terrific seasons. With forward status, his history and the fact he's not even 30, he has to be on your watchlist for 2024. However, I have the feeling we'll see much the same in terms of role for Macrae and we all know what that means. But in a weak forward pool, it will still be enough to be a top forward. Update: Smith out for the year should only help his cause. Although it sounds like Sanders has stepped right into an inside mid spot. I'll still need to see his role in the pre-season.

His 24% contested possession rate, nine lower than the Top six defenders at 33%, is why he averaged 85 in SuperCoach and 91 in AFL Fantasy.

However, he returned to an 98 average in 2023, and unlike his underwhelming scoring seasons of 2021 and 2020, he wasn't hampered by injury. It appeared that Carlton made a switch to move the ball quicker, which led to less possessions for their mids. Cripps' impact was still as strong as ever, he just didn't have the consistently high SuperCoach scoring games that he did in 2022. It worked, with Carlton storming home and making a prelim. I imagine Carlton adopting a similar method in 2024 and that means Cripps will score more like his 2023 season, than his 2022. Therefore he's not the value that he appears to be based on his discount to career high average.","Is a top-line SuperCoacher when at his best, including his Brownlow winning 2022, but been a 90s guy for three of the last four which makes the bounce back to 110+ unlikely",,,,33,35,38,58,3,126,-16,-21,153,57, 3 / 24, 11 / 24, 10 / 24, 4 / 24, 0 / 24,81,79,76.66666667,77.36363636,81.8,82.75,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,97.52380952,0,98.57142857,-1,95.42857143,3,84.75,13,90.33333333,8,96.625,1,119.4090909,96.625,111.1428571,83.55,97.47058824,117.1,119.4090909,97.73333333,19,54,13,123,62,7,6,27,136.971831,119.9069286,136.971831,99.46428571,114.1971054,130.2558398,133.4179787,117.3269308,-22.78409091,-14.51785714,27.59285714,-13.92058824,-19.62941176,-2.309090909,21.67575758,-9.885714286,24.83333333,70.8754381,53.89651387,3.916666667,5.416666667,6.75,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

CD_I993905,Callum Mills,9,Snr,86,103,490300,88,Full,M70,M39,34,21,5,0,"No easy way to put it, Mills had a shocker in 2023. After back-to-back 112+ seasons, nothing went right in 2023 and he dropped his average by a massive 28 points per game. It started with him forced to play a key defensive role after many of the Swans' key backs went down. His defensive attributes and versatility has always been a burden for him in SuperCoach, often shifted to be loose man in defence or to a wing and play behind the ball. But never key defence. He averaged 12% CBAs from Round 4-6, including 0% in Round 5. He didn't score over 100 in this time. Swans then got some players back and Mills started building in the midfield, with 47% then 63% CBAs in Round 7 and 8. However, he popped a calf in the first minute of Round 9 when on 4. He returned in Round 15 when Swans beat WC by 171 and was subbed off just after half time. So all these scenarios have been built into his price for 2024, which is at an average of 88. He showed he still had it when he scored 143 in the final round of the season. However, there were still seven sub-100 scores 10, including a 38(!) in Round 23, despite being back to fitness. And to top it off, he injured himself on Mad Monday and will miss the start of the season.","Nothing went right in 2024 and to top it off, he injured himself on Mad Monday and will miss the start of the season - stash for draft with potential defender status coming",,,,48,50,58,64,8,116,-21,-27,143,4, 2 / 20, 5 / 20, 9 / 20, 3 / 20, 1 / 20,77,0,55,51.6,38.77777778,33.33333333,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,87.73684211,0,87.33333333,1,88.1,0,81.6,6,75,13,91.47368421,-3,115.12,87.1,115.12,112.4444444,101.4,81.77272727,79,73.33333333,32,99,7,17,49,101,104,112,138.5352498,109.9747475,136.2689394,138.5352498,113.5074627,95.0845666,91.32947977,90.42334566,-28.02,-28.02,2.675555556,11.04444444,19.62727273,2.772727273,5.666666667,-1.348484848,20.15,75.42842982,33.63325831,2.65,4.4,2,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

He started hot, averaging 120 in his first 2, before injuring his MCL in Round 3 before 3/4 time when on 89. He missed the next six weeks, before being eased back in, starting as the sub in Round 10 (64% TOG) and 75% TOG in Round 11, averaging just 71. He then averaged 101 in his next 3, including a game rucking against the Gawn/Grundy combo and looked to be a top six forward candidate for the run home. However, Cameron missed a week for injury and Mason Cox started to take more of the centre-bounce ruck contests, and had a great impact. So much so that Cox was the Pie's number one ruck throughout the finals series, leaving Cameron to attend 33% of the centre bounces during the finals. With McStay out for the season and Cox's influence late in the year, there's a chance we see Cameron spend more time forward in 2024 and now that he's lost his forward status, he doesn't present as a great starting option in Fantasy.",Spent more time forward late in the season with Cox being the main man and we might see more of that in 2024 with McStay down,,,,11,11,10,9,11,121,-4,0,137,59, 3 / 19, 7 / 19, 9 / 19, 5 / 19, 0 / 19,68,48,72.66666667,63.57142857,64.77777778,57,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,92.1875,0,95.42857143,-3,89.66666667,2,84.8,7,92.66666667,-1,92.26315789,0,92.26315789,92.26315789,86.08333333,77.27777778,52.7,,25,,158,74,117,160,335,,290,,124.4144784,124.4144784,112.7729258,94.43312967,70.73825503,,52.85412262,,0,6.179824561,8.805555556,24.57777778,27.7,,,,13.10526316,66.3281882,63.5179678,2.947368421,3.210526316,7.736842105,19.83605072,68.0662828,50.52076619,3.533514493,4.569746377,8.969202899,HO to Adv

Despite putting up big numbers in the reserves, it appeared the Crows had moved on from Crouch. However, he returned to the team in Round 16 and played the rest of the season. He averaged 6.4 clearances a game and many thought he played career best football - as previously he has been criticised for being just an accumulator and getting cheap footy. He averaged 108 SuperCoach points in that time and 112 in his L5 - which shows those people might have a point. I was shocked to see he's still only 28, so there's no reason why the Crows should be moving past him if he continues to play the inside role he did last year.

He looked to be a future star of the comp in his 3rd season when he averaged 95 in second half and 110 in his last 5. With CBAs increasing in line, and low TOG, he ticked all the boxes for a breakout. However, he's played just the 22 games since with a mixture of form, injury and personal issues. In his 12 games last season, he still showed he can mix it with the best and boasts a very impressive stat profile. He averages a better disposal efficiency, contested rate and more goals than the average top eight mid. Impressively, he averaged 4.3 clearances a game in 2023, despite attending 57% CBAs and having less than 20 disposals a game. However, with North recruiting another gun mid with Pick two and Sheezel tipped to play more inside, it's unlikely we'll see him increase those CBAs to a level which would see him win enough possessions to compete with the top 8.

He battled with hamstring and knee issues in 2021 and a groin issue in 2022, which finally gave way with a complete rupture of his adductor in the final. This delayed his pre-season in 2023, however it was more the role change that hurt his scoring, dropping to just 39% CBAs and used as a pressure forward the most of the season. This led to a trade request to the Swans for supposedly more midfield time. The Swans certainly aren't short midfielders, however they do love a tough inside mid and Adams is every bit of that. In a season with a lack of forward options, Adams is exactly what we're looking for - underpriced, top six potential and potential for a bump in midfield time. The issue is the early bye in Round 5, but I'm prepared to start players with an early bye if they are value, which Adams is.

After a breakout season in 2020 which saw him increase his average by 22 points per game, he improved again in 2021 by another four points to 97 points per game and 105 post-bye. However, he stagnated in 2022, reducing his average by six despite increased CBAs and then nothing went right in 2023 as he battled with multiple injures and dripped his average by 12 points per game. A hand injury and two concussions saw him have three games with less than 50% game time, with a 12, 24 and 66. Removing those games he averaged 88, so still a level below his best, but it's hard to hit peak form if you miss regular games for injury. A lot of that might have also been due to how bad the Kangaroos were as scores are generally lower for losing teams. The rise of LDU also took some ball off him and with the depth of their midfield now, he spent some time forward. All of these factors are likely to continue, so I doubt he's ever going to become a premium SuperCoach mid. Unless he gets forward status during the season, I think he's going to be more of a Fantasy option than SuperCoach.","3 injured games last year means he's underpriced, but with Roos struggles and the new depth in the midfield, it's unlikely Simpkin will be an uber mid in SuperCoach",,,,64,66,80,53,34,108,-9,-18,121,12, 1 / 18, 3 / 18, 13 / 18, 5 / 18, 3 / 18,81,20,81,70,60,47.2,22.33333333,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,79.33333333,0,80.18181818,-1,78,1,87,-8,,,88.4,-9,97.18181818,79.33333333,90.85714286,97.18181818,93,70.52380952,66,46.69230769,121,156,89,45,76,175,170,224,120.1367781,102.2922636,105.0082554,117.2792101,120.1367781,92.06763645,87.3015873,67.37706738,-17.84848485,-11.52380952,-6.324675325,4.181818182,22.47619048,4.523809524,19.30769231,,20.66666667,72.71990841,41.98604682,3.777777778,3.944444444,4.222222222,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

His intercepting was a feature, averaging 7.2 per game, compared to the top six defenders 6.5.

Common sense prevailed and he got out of there, landing at the Swans where he'll take the solo ruck role.

He spent much of his debut season on the wing, which never bodes well for SuperCoach scoring given the favourable scoring to those with a high contested possession rate. He ended up seeing less inside minutes in 2023 (23% CBAs compared to 38% in his debut season). I certainly didn't expect Nash (69%), Worpel (67%) and Day (63%) to pick up that much of the slack. Of those, Day isn't going anywhere, winning the B&F and showing he's a future star of the comp. Nash came 3rd in the B&F and Mitchell loves him, so his role will likely remain. Newcombe (70%) came second. That leaves Worpel, and my view is that Hawks should move past him and give more minutes to the youngsters in Ward and Mackenzie.

At his price, he's certainly not worth the risk.","Was back in the team after just 19 games in three seasons and when conditions suited, scored well, but will be on the fringe again in 2024",,,,78,81,37,64,59,101,13,-5,112,21, 0 / 17, 3 / 17, 13 / 17, 7 / 17, 3 / 17,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,33.66666667,29,20.28571429,11.66666667,72.29411765,0,70.16666667,2,73.45454545,-1,75.2,-3,,,80.5,-9,77.2,72.29411765,41.14285714,45.625,50.5,75.5,76.6,77.2,283,219,498,414,343,140,122,94,101.5702479,101.5702479,71.64179104,66.97247706,74.26470588,89.13813459,91.51732378,94.37652812,-4.905882353,31.1512605,-4.482142857,-4.875,-25,-1.1,-0.6,3.033333333,20.29411765,80.43775776,23.41152124,1.823529412,1.117647059,3,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He had excuses, injuring his hand in Round 1 on 89 from just 70% game time and then struggled on return. He started as sub in Round 10 scoring 39 and then was subbed off in Round 11 with concussion on 22. He returned as a sub for two games, scoring 19 and 17, before finishing the season playing his typical inside role at the Blues, averaging 99 in the L5. He's pretty important to their structure and often takes the opposition's best mid, so I expect him to stay at over 65% CBAs in 2024 despite their star-studded midfield. His proven to be capable of 100+ in this role, however he'd need to average 105+ again which I doubt he can do. Additionally, the Round 2 bye throws a curveball and for that reason it's hard to consider him in your starting squad.","A down year plagued by injuries following a terrific 2022, or was 2022 just an outlier?",,,,66,65,34,32,13,107,-28,-32,142,17, 3 / 22, 4 / 22, 14 / 22, 8 / 22, 4 / 22,71,22,79.33333333,77.5,51.5,36,19.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,78.73684211,0,76,3,81.77777778,-3,99,-20,86.33333333,-7,92.11111111,-13,111.4,79.77272727,111.4,74.85714286,77.5,87.95454545,78.34782609,73.58333333,48,152,12,181,156,72,112,111,143.9276486,121.6216216,143.9276486,95.2150212,96.07438017,107.0006636,94.85208969,96.43949323,-31.62727273,-31.62727273,36.54285714,-2.642857143,-10.45454545,9.606719368,4.764492754,16.79166667,20.22727273,77.96222195,47.78389655,2.090909091,4.636363636,3.545454545,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

However, a trade to Port in the off-season should see him become the number one ruck and hopefully see the TOG and CBA levels of other top rucks. He played three full games without Nank in 2023, attending 71%, 72% and 85% CBAs for a 126, 79 and 128. He's shown he can average 100+ number one and at 27, he should be peaking as a ruck. I've got him taking a bit leap in 2023 and maybe in a year without a discounted Gawn, Grundy and Xerri and an early bye, he'd be right in the range for the R2 spot. Add to that, he's missed a big chunk of the pre-season due to a finger injury, so it's likely Sweet will take the number one mantle into the start of the season.","A move to Port should see him take the number one mantle, where he's shown he can score, but a finger injury in the pre-season might open up the door for Sweet to start in that role",,,,13,13,9,10,13,116,17,0,128,41, 2 / 8, 3 / 8, 5 / 8, 2 / 8, 0 / 8,85,33,78,64.33333333,41.6,30,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,86.875,0,85,2,87.14285714,0,81,6,,,86.875,0,86.875,86.875,54,,75,73.21428571,80,46.14285714,198,104,403,,170,157,100,226,125.4512635,125.4512635,86.02941176,,111.1111111,110.7629133,92.80742459,76.39545885,0,32.875,-21,,1.785714286,-6.785714286,33.85714286,,9.75,73.19444444,55.78914141,2.5,3.75,7.875,19.83605072,68.0662828,50.52076619,3.533514493,4.569746377,8.969202899,HO to Adv

The second year player was in genuine rising star conversations in a field which saw two of the best rookies of all time. He did it in a different manner, playing as a medium sized forward, averaging just 15 disposals, but more than half of them contested with over a goal a game. He was used as an inside mid at times in his debut season and as a second ruck last year, which obviously aided his scoring. With Jack Hayes set to return, I doubt we'll see Owens in that second ruck role. So unless we see him back playing some inside mid again, it's hard to see him improving on last year. That is hard to say as typically players take a leap in their third season and Owens is better than your average third year player. He has all the attributes to be a SuperCoach stud in the future, but I think we can rule him out as a starting option if he remains as a forward in the pre-season matches.","Serious talent who does it in an unconventional way, might lose his second ruck minutes to Hayes so unless he turns into an inside mid, where he has been used before, it's hard to see improvement in year 3",,,,21,22,20,72,22,108,24,0,143,42, 1 / 23, 4 / 23, 17 / 23, 8 / 23, 1 / 23,3,10,3,5,20.76470588,25.625,10,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,79.68181818,0,86.4,-6,74.08333333,6,65.4,15,77,3,81.27272727,-1,79.56521739,79.56521739,50.42857143,,,,,,261,155,430,,,,,,96.36650869,96.36650869,72.48459959,,,,,,0,29.13664596,,,,,,,15.04347826,69.68336331,53.97672577,2.391304348,3.782608696,1.130434783,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

He teased us when introduced into the midfield in 2019, averaging 90 after Round 10, but managed just 14 games the next two seasons. He's since split his time between the middle and forward, but Ross Lyon wasn't a fan and played him as a forward, averaging just 22% CBAs post-bye and 7% in the L5. His scoring has been limited due to an unfavourable combination of low contested rate (below 40%) and low efficiency (62%). He now finds himself at the Dons and their midfield is pretty one paced. They've used Jake Stringer in there in the past to add some forward-half damage but he's past it now, and I think there's an opportunity for Gresham to see some time in there.

He returned to play a shutdown role on Charlie Cameron in Round 3 and that was his ticket back to defence. He averaged 91 in his next 6, with three scores over 98, and looked like he was back. However, a significant hamstring injury in Round 10 saw him miss nine weeks. He returned to play two more before an ankle injury finished his season. Hopefully Bevo has taken note and will keep him in his preferred role this this season. That could see him push the 90 mark, which is over 15 points more than he's priced at.

However, Kinglsey decided to put him back to the forward-line to start the season, and he averaged 67 through eight rounds. The Giants were had just two wins and had to change something up. It was Round 9 where Himmelberg was moved back to defence, however it ended early, out with concussion in the first quarter. So by the time he returned in Round 12, he had an average of 64. From there, he remained in defence and averaged 95. The 110 from 2022 was always going to be a reach, given the more direct style played under Kingsley and that Whitfield and Ash were both used in defence in 2023, so Himmelberg had to share the load. It's been said that the Giants are going to settle Himmelberg as a defender in 2024, which is great news for his SuperCoach prospects and means he's 15+ points under-priced. However, the early bye means it's hard to do, and he'll likely be below the top six anyway.","Didn't hit the heights he did post-bye in 2022 (110), but averaged 95 when moved to defence in 2023 and said to be staying there in 2024",,,,44,47,43,10,20,109,-4,-10,129,34, 2 / 25, 4 / 25, 18 / 25, 6 / 25, 1 / 25,0,0,0,0.75,7.5,6.833333333,0,33,8,41.5,35.25,19.44444444,3.666666667,8,80.59090909,0,69.38461538,12,96.77777778,-16,101.6,-21,80,1,82.45833333,-1,90.63636364,80.52,90.63636364,70.83333333,66.1,76.2,70.8,49.2,172,143,92,210,227,135,148,215,99.8997996,99.60415636,99.8997996,77.62557078,76.86046512,85.90755355,82.51748252,60.44226044,-10.11636364,-10.11636364,19.8030303,4.733333333,-10.1,5.4,21.6,-7,18.24,77.72422507,33.06970457,2.6,1.76,4.4,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He averaged 47% CBAs for the first six rounds of the season and gave the Crows a nice injection of pace in the middle. In that time, he averaged 89 points. Surprisingly, he averaged just 12% CBAs for the rest of the season and 68 points. They preferred Rory Sloane, Ben Keays and later Matt Crouch in there ahead of him. I've said before the Crows' midfield is a little one paced, especially a few years ago when they were running with Laird, Crouch, Berry, Schoenberg and Sloane. Dawson's move in there last year proved a masterstroke and he provided the point of difference, plus they look to have moved on from Berry and Schoenberg. But I think there is still room for the young Rachele to add some spark, and if we get an indication in the pre-season that he'll get 40%+ CBAs, then he could be the mid-priced forward we're hunting for, but it's much harder to take that risk in the limited trade format and based off his role to finish 2023, that might be optimistic.","Got a taste of the midfield early in 2023 with 47% CBAs in first six, dropped off as the season went on but I think the Crows need him in there more",,,,33,35,19,73,35,102,25,0,116,29, 0 / 21, 2 / 21, 14 / 21, 8 / 21, 1 / 21,29,17,,39.5,17.14285714,10,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,73.95238095,0,80.61538462,-7,63.125,11,65,9,,,74.45,0,73.95238095,73.95238095,52.15384615,,,,,,321,203,420,,,,,,96.76012461,96.76012461,65.19230769,,,,,,0,21.7985348,,,,,,,15.28571429,69.34594529,34.51462463,2.952380952,3.333333333,1.095238095,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

I expected him too see some midfield time last season following the departures of Mitchell and JOM, however it never eventuated. He showed improvement over the year, despite the limited role, averaging 61 pre-bye, 76 post and 82 in his L5. He can obviously score, getting 37 touches and 126 AFL Fantasy points in his one VFL game last year. However, at that price you'll need him to average close to the 100 mark to prove a worthwhile selection and he won't do that if he remains as a pure forward.

He got off to a great start and was very impressive in both pre-season games with a clear inside mid role. He then started well in Round 1, but was then pushed to a wing after Tom Stewart was subbed off. He played 64% TOG that night, then 62% in R2 and 58% R3, none of them sub-impacted games, and then was dropped in R4. This was the story of his season, tastes of inside minutes with 49% CBAs but just 63% TOG. He scored 111 AFL Fantasy points in the VFL game, making it six career VFL games over 100 out of 10, so I think he has the ability. I also think Geelong need to buy into their rebuild and give players like Bruhn more opportunity.

He started in the opening centre bounce of 2023, however injured his hamstring in the opening minutes on 1, forcing him to miss the next four weeks. He returned in Round 6 and had 79% CBAs, so he was obviously in Kingsley's plans to play as a midfielder. However, he moved back to defence after Round 10, seeing CBAs in just one other match for the season. This coincided with Giants getting on a roll, so you'd think he will remain in that role in 2024. He averaged 73 in this time, so while he comes into 2024 with defender status, discounted due to his early injury and 19 points below his career best, it's unlikely he'll improve on his 2023 average if his post-bye role and scoring are anything to go by.","Returned to defence post-bye when Giants started to roll, so you'd think his wing/midfield days are done along with those 90+ scores",,,,70,64,38,80,13,102,-21,-21,125,1, 1 / 22, 3 / 22, 17 / 22, 8 / 22, 1 / 22,31,6,31,10.33333333,15.94117647,7.625,6,0,0,0,0,0.470588235,0,0,73.63157895,0,73.8,0,73.44444444,1,68.6,5,88,-14,79.14285714,-5,94.5,75.59090909,94.5,91.38888889,94,78.52631579,57.66666667,49.875,139,184,66,70,71,121,225,213,121.4457831,100.9101942,121.4457831,113.8408304,114.2857143,101.4551884,81.79669031,75,-18.90909091,-18.90909091,3.111111111,-2.611111111,15.47368421,20.85964912,7.791666667,,17.63636364,69.93130208,34.89173428,3,4.181818182,4.909090909,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He backed that up with a respectable 105 but then the dreaded OP struck, and he's missed more than 50% of games since and struggled with his output. A calf injury just before Round 1 after looking the goods as a midfielder in the pre-season games wasn't the ideal start. He then played two games before Round 11 after dealing with groin issues, averaging just 50. However, he started to find his groove, averaging 101 for the four games to Round 15, before hurting his hip - the trifecta! He went on to play four more games, but was managed throughout, including being used as the sub. All that together left with a 80 average for the season. If he's healthy, he can easily average 100+, whether that's as a defender in the absence of Shannon Hurn or as a mature inside mid. Him being healthy is the big question and a risk that anyone will take who pick him. In the limited trade format where you really need him to be a top six defender to be a decent selection, he's too much of a risk for me. Update: He's fit (for now), he's full time mid and I'm on board.","Hasn't played more than 12 games in the last four seasons so his body is always a concern, but if fully fit he's still a very good player IRL and SuperCoach and all reports he is",,,,49,50,7,69,6,109,-13,-27,125,44, 1 / 10, 2 / 10, 6 / 10, 3 / 10, 1 / 10,67,22,67,48,24.5,7.333333333,0,0,10,0,16.5,14.33333333,11,14,80,0,82.4,-2,77.6,2,73.75,6,,,83.44444444,-3,107.12,80,68,85.36363636,89.9,105.1304348,107.12,98.7826087,63,149,247,105,87,22,15,24,129.7906602,121.5805471,112.9568106,111.4650312,111.8159204,129.7906602,122.8440367,114.8634985,-27.12,12,-17.36363636,-4.536363636,-15.23043478,-1.989565217,8.337391304,25.0326087,17.4,80.43707827,40.35536131,2.7,3.4,4,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He showed he has the makings to be a star defender of the future, but injures stopped him from a full breakout. The story was much the same in 2023. He was concussed in Round 1 on 69, forcing him to miss Round 2. He returned to average just 63 in his next nine to the bye, looking a shadow of the player that broke out a year earlier. He was so far out of form that he started as sub post-bye, which is where he scored his 29. After that, he was quoted saying ""I just thought to myself to back myself. Thats when I play my best footy, when Im just out there, playing freely and playing on instinct"". And he did. He averaged 90 in his last seven matches, which included another injury (eye) when saw him sit off just after half time and miss two more matches. He then went to another level in the finals, averaging 102, including a best on ground performance in the prelim and 22 disposals to half time (over 100) in the GF. While Rich was a non-factor last year, his retirement means that Coleman is now the number one distributor for the Lions, a role which can yield an 95+ average. However, he'll need to push the 100 mark to be a worthwhile mid-priced selection in this format. If it weren't for the Round 2 bye, I'd be prepared to start with him, but I don't think I can with that bye.","Interrupted 2023 but his finish caught the eye (97 in L3, 106 in finals) and he comes in as a nice, discounted defender, if it wasn't for that Round 2 bye",,,,81,62,32,17,26,100,-20,-16,127,29, 2 / 23, 5 / 23, 17 / 23, 14 / 23, 1 / 23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19.5,0,19.5,18.8,19.58823529,15.71428571,0,71.35,0,63.8,7,78.9,-8,97.33333333,-26,106,-35,78,-7,87.38888889,75.86956522,87.38888889,52.75,53,,,,187,181,105,372,332,,,,117.2131148,103.8690476,117.2131148,80.99808061,67.77493606,,,,-11.51932367,-11.51932367,34.63888889,-0.25,,,,,17.04347826,72.14442124,29.06064802,2.434782609,2.695652174,5,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

He led the comp in tackles per game, which was a great achievement for a 21-year-old in his first full season in the midfield. However, Berry's 17.6 disposals per game was low for a main midfielder and with Laird already offering tackle pressure (number two on the tackle list that year), the Crows looked to add some more speed and dynamic movement in there last season. That meant Berry spent most of the year playing SANFL, with just four games at AFL level after 35 in his first two seasons. Laird and Dawson are locked into the midfield and they opted for Crouch as the third mid to finish 2023. I doubt much will change this season, but hopefully we see more of Berry in 2024. If we do, he just needs to average 70 to make $150k and we know he can do that, so he's certainly worth considering.","An 87 in his second season looked like he'd be a future stud, but the Crows have gone quicker inside now leaving him on the outer",,,,132,128,126,,53,69,-24,-46,58,45, 0 / 4, 0 / 4, 4 / 4, 4 / 4, 1 / 4,68,38,,,55.5,55.5,38,0,0,,,0,0,0,50.75,-10,50.75,-10,,,,,,,52.66666667,-12,86.94444444,50.75,86.94444444,46,,,,,197,453,111,413,,,,,119.7398623,78.37837838,119.7398623,64.1509434,,,,,-36.19444444,-36.19444444,40.94444444,,,,,,10,62.34848485,49.45512821,1.75,4.75,2,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

He was traded to North in the off-season in a trade that could really unlock his potential. After playing just one of 13 games from Round 8, the small forward came back into the side in Round 21 as a running half-back. He had 32 disposals in that game and remained there for the next 3, before being dropped for finals. Around the trade, Fisher noted that Clarkson earmarked him to play as a running defender at the Roos as they look to add to their run and carry game. We've seen the primary Roo defender rack up Fantasy points in recent years, from Luke McDonald in 2020, Jack Ziebell and Aaron Hall in 2021 and Harry Sheezel last season. With Hall and Ziebell retired and Sheezel a chance to progress into the midfield, Fisher is every chance to land that role. At his price, he'll need to average 96 for the $150k to make him a good mid-priced selection. He managed 86 in that role at the Blues, but he had Newman and Saad taking a lot of the distribution off him. I think he'll fall just short of the 96, but he's not a bad option give he might not be far behind the F6. Update: That role was there but he's now had two hamstring issues which is a red flag, I am okay taking on an injury risk like Yeo, but interrupted pre-season is another issue.","Might not have seen like much at the time, but could be a very relevant off-season move if he lands himself in the plumb distribution role at the Roos, but multiple hamstring issues in the pre-season is a red flag",,,,55,56,47,26,37,96,-9,-6,126,31, 1 / 12, 1 / 12, 10 / 12, 8 / 12, 0 / 12,0,10,0,0,4.8,3.625,,0,0,0,0,5,6.25,,67.75,0,59.625,8,84,-16,84,-16,,,67.75,0,73.54545455,67.75,73.54545455,64.9,73.375,65.57142857,72.35294118,47.94117647,326,267,203,260,178,212,137,222,97.18543046,88.0823402,91.82746879,81.84110971,97.18543046,83.00180832,95.70494865,68.58537406,-5.795454545,-5.795454545,8.645454545,-8.475,7.803571429,-6.781512605,24.41176471,,20.83333333,72.14634109,27.38371294,2.75,1.333333333,0.333333333,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

Kingsley came in and put things straight, with Whitfield and Ash back in defence and later Himmelberg who moved back to finish the season. This pushed Cumming up to a wing, which as we know isn't a good thing for Fantasy scoring. He averaged 65 post-bye and didn't take a kick-in to finish the year. This coincided with the Giants' best form of the year, so I'm not sure there is a spot for Cumming in defence in 2024, at least not the high distribution role he had in 2022. I'm not banking on a large bounce back this season at least.","Not many 25-year-olds drop 26 points per game without an injury, has to bounce back but no longer the main distributor with Whitfield, Ash and Himmelberg back now",,,,89,94,86,100,13,98,-20,-26,104,39, 0 / 20, 1 / 20, 18 / 20, 11 / 20, 0 / 20,0,0,,0,0,0,,56,0,,56,20.16666667,12.63636364,,69.35294118,0,74.5,-6,64.77777778,4,61.2,8,62.33333333,7,68.3,1,94.66666667,68.3,94.66666667,90.04166667,67,56.4,40,,135,262,64,78,219,284,282,,114.1216992,86.29185092,114.1216992,112.2014538,79.13385827,78.11634349,66.88963211,,-26.36666667,-26.36666667,4.625,23.04166667,10.6,16.4,,,16.7,74.3228519,27.98512599,2.55,2.45,3.75,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

With Wines, Boak, Butters, Rozee and Drew, I doubted he would see more than this for a team in contention, however he finished with 59% CBAs to be a clear first-choice midfielder. If you're looking at pure disposal stats, you'd say he had a modest season, averaging less than 18 touches per game. However, he finished the year with 16 Brownlow votes, the same as sensation Tom Green. He tore some games apart with his clearance work and penetration inside 50 from stoppages. However, he lacked consistency and easy possessions. He had nine games sub 70. He's yet to have a full pre-season, so maybe that explains why he doesn't do much outside of a stoppage. But he's in the Patrick Dangerfield mold, and Danger took four seasons before he averaged over 80. I expect him to add some more disposals to his game this year. However, with Wines hoping to spend more time inside also, I don't think we'll see a significant bump from JHF this year.","Clear talent but in the high impact low disposals bucket at the moment, his first full pre-season might see him win more ball but I think he'll need a few more years before his best",,,,69,70,82,76,70,106,8,1,136,36, 2 / 24, 4 / 24, 18 / 24, 9 / 24, 0 / 24,67,50,61,58.75,58.83333333,57,,0,0,0,0,0,0,,77.63636364,0,82.78571429,-5,68.625,9,74.4,4,73.5,5,77.29166667,1,77.29166667,77.29166667,63.35294118,,,,,,282,170,295,,,,,,101.2002182,101.2002182,83.03777949,,,,,,0,13.93872549,,,,,,,17.58333333,68.55098429,51.31981978,4.125,2.875,4.791666667,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

He hasn't come on from there, failing to average above 81. Hes also had a shocking run of injuries, and while he managed 19 matches last season, he missed six weeks in the middle with a knee injury when he was on 3. He was also sub on a few occasions, with four games under 50% TOG. The positive was that he was injected back into the midfielder, with 31% CBAs from his 58% season TOG. The downside is that he lost his defender status, which is what kept him on my radar his whole career. A clean run of injury will see a nice improvement in output in 2024, as his ranked 103rd in price yet 36th for points per minute. But he's too risky of a play as a MID-only option.

CD_I1004965,Tristan Xerri,7,Snr,101,108,407400,73,Unders,R8,R6,5,17,12,6,"After sitting behind Goldstein for many years, it looked like North had finally decided to look to the future when they named Xerri sole ruck in Round 1 and Goldy emergency. After getting off to a flyer (35 points in 15% TOG), he did his syndesmosis and missed the next 15 weeks. After 113 AFL Fantasy points in the VFL, he returned to the senior side again as sole ruck, seeing 84% CBAs for a 102.. He was sole ruck the following week but found things tougher against the Reeves/Meek duo (many did in 2023) and scored 75. However he was never solo again, averaging 43% CBAs for the final six matches sharing with Goldy. Goldy has now been moved on and we should see Xerri solo for 2024. He has the scoring ability and now should have the opportunity and with no early bye like the other value ruck plays (Gawn and Grundy). The difference between him being a nice value play in AF and a R2 option in SC is that you're going to need him to either be a keeper (which is very unlikely - 115 average) or at least average enough to earn 150k, which is 101. With the inflated scoring rucks get in this game, 101 is on the lower end of my projections, so I think we'll see him make the 150k. Update: face surgery will keep him out of contact training for a few weeks, but he should still be able to keep up his fitness.","Started Round 1 sole ruck but an early injury meant he never had a proper crack at it, with Goldy now gone, it's Xerri time",,,,18,18,16,15,18,101,-7,0,102,35, 0 / 9, 1 / 9, 7 / 9, 3 / 9, 1 / 9,84,18,,84,45.28571429,43.66666667,18,0,0,,0,0,0,0,72.88888889,0,35,38,77.625,-5,71.2,2,,,77.625,-5,72.88888889,72.88888889,71.41666667,38.25,49.5,,,,334,216,215,441,347,,,,103.9619651,103.9619651,95.01108647,50.66225166,58.06451613,,,,0,1.472222222,33.16666667,-11.25,,,,,11.44444444,69.36677845,69.93476023,2.666666667,2.888888889,6,19.83605072,68.0662828,50.52076619,3.533514493,4.569746377,8.969202899,HO to Adv

After an impressive debut season, Windhager was made to work for his opportunities in his second season. A broken hand in the pre-season match saw him miss Round 1 and then start as the sub in Round 2. He was sub in three of the his first six matches before being dropped to the VFL. It's here he showed his scoring power, scoring 98, 157, 91 and 120 AFL Fantasy points in his four matches. This shouldnt come as a great surprise considering he scored over 110 AFL Fantasy points twice in three games at the level in 2022. He was back in the senior side in Round 13 and didn't miss a game after that. He moved to the half-back in Round 17 and played there for the final nine games of the season, averaging 76. Personally I found the move odd as the one knock on him is his kicking, he's certainly better suited inside mid.

He was limited to just four games in his draft year due to hamstring injuries but of those, was best on ground in Round 1 and BOG again in the AFL Academy game. He was on a modified pre-season program and didn't debut until Round 10, but it was one of the better debuts you'll see - 16 touches, six clearances and nine tackles from 63% TOG. He backed it up in Round 13 with 22 touches, six clearances and nine tackles from 70% TOG and 22 touches and seven tackles from 68% in Round 16. However, he was a late out Round 17 and subbed out in Round 18 and then played just the one more game for the year where he again had nine tackles in 55% TOG. In all he finished the season with eight matches at just 60% TOG. He's now had his first full pre-season under his belt which should see him bump up to at least 70% TOG. At the same PPM, he would average 78, which isn't enough. Daicos's 2nd year breakout was another level given he came off a high base but Clayton Oliver and Tim Taranto were at a similar price point where you can afford to wait to see how they look (role, TOG, score) in the early rounds and trade them in if they tick the boxes. That's how I'll play it I think.","Caught the eye in limited opportunities in his debut season and looks a future star, second year breakouts are rare but he's one who could be up to it",,,,99,100,60,53,100,94,,0,94,30, 0 / 8, 0 / 8, 7 / 8, 4 / 8, 1 / 8,62,14,,,44.71428571,40.5,14,0,0,,,0,0,0,65.375,0,66.6,-2,63.33333333,2,87,-22,,,70.42857143,-5,65.375,65.375,,,,,,,409,299,,,,,,,109.8739496,109.8739496,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,14.625,76.62502122,44.31151007,3.25,5.75,4.125,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

He looked to arrive in 2021, averaging 104 in the first eight games, but has battled with injury ever since. A hamstring injury stopped his breakout in 2021 and then surgery in the pre-season ruled him out for the first four months of 2022. He arrived at Geelong last season and looked to have a mid role in the first pre-season game before a hamstring injury saw him just play a half. After missing Round 1, he played five matches with only one with CBAs. He then hurt his calf on 15 and missed the next six weeks. He returned as sub for the next three matches, scoring 17, 41 and 25. He's hard to read as is the Cats, who played him back, wing, on-ball and forward in 2023. If he can settle in a position he might prove a great pick, but he hasn't been reliable so far in his career so it's too risky for me.","Didn't get the mid time we expected after moving to the Cats and even when he did, he didn't catch the eye but a full pre-season and four sub games means he's underpriced heading into 2024",,,,115,119,69,112,39,89,-12,-23,108,15, 0 / 17, 1 / 17, 14 / 17, 9 / 17, 4 / 17,0,0,,0,10.42857143,11.44444444,17.75,25,0,,25,5.5,4.333333333,0,61.17647059,0,69.66666667,-9,56.54545455,4,57.4,4,,,72.46153846,-11,84,61.17647059,63,82.89473684,84,75.73333333,64.125,48.54545455,215,339,305,126,109,138,182,220,103.8233355,90.82969432,88.98305085,103.8233355,101.6370107,101.2477718,82.00127877,67.33072752,-22.82352941,-1.823529412,-19.89473684,-1.105263158,8.266666667,11.60833333,15.57954545,,15.35294118,71.0700964,42.24004848,2.764705882,2.352941176,3.882352941,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

Sadly, this has been the consistent story for Preuss his entire career and it allowed Briggs to take the number one mantle last season and run with it.

Unfortunately, he hasn't gone on with it, dropping his average in every season since to finish on 62 last year from just three matches after a broken leg ruled him out for the first half of the season. At 28, he should be in his prime and may appear underpriced to what he could produce and an off-season move to the Dees might change things for him. It will be very interesting to see how the Dees use him. On the watch-list for the pre-season and I guess we'll get a proper indication in the opening round.

He was thrown in the deep end playing inside mid for a team who struggled most weeks, but it was a clear sign they have big wraps on the kid. He showed a great tackle ability (5.9 per game, in line with the top eight mids) and contested possession rate (46.4%, above that of the top eight mids), however struggled to win the ball outside the contest (13.7 disposals and 1.5 marks per game). That will come, but I doubt it will see a big spike in his second season. He's in great condition on the training track and I'm looking forward to see how he looks in the pre-season games, but out of the second year players, I don't think he's the one that will have the big impact.","Big bodied mid has got even bigger this off-season and could certainly breakout, just not sure he has the outside game to be a worthy Fantasy option just yet",,,,102,105,98,,105,92,,0,108,9, 0 / 17, 2 / 17, 14 / 17, 11 / 17, 1 / 17,54,0,,61,41.28571429,39.09090909,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,63.47058824,0,68.84615385,-6,46,17,,,,,66.875,-4,63.47058824,63.47058824,,,,,,,421,319,,,,,,,90.90143218,90.90143218,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,13.70588235,70.54436897,46.40215902,3.117647059,5.941176471,2.470588235,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

The former Pick 13 averaged 68 in his first season after 35 disposals per game in SANFL Under-18s in his draft year. He's since been in and out of the side and averaged 56 points per game in the last two seasons. He got a bit of a bump in midfield time, which included 29% CBAs post-bye to net a 68 average. He will remain on the radar given he has forward status and talent at junior level, however with another batch of young players coming in at the Roos, it's going to be harder for him in 2024 to get the opportunity.

He didn't play again at AFL level that season, but after a 158 AFL Fantasy points at VFL level, he featured in Round 7 last season for the first time since. He was subbed out on just 11 and went back to the VFL where he scored a 130 AFL Fantasy points. He played again at AFL level in Round 10 where he started sub and scored just 9, and also played VFL that week for a 118 AF. So while his career scores at AFL read 43, 11 and 9, he showed at the level below that he had something special. We then finally saw him get a decent run at AFL level, playing four games in a row at 87, despite playing just 64% TOG. He then did his syndesmosis in Round 17 on 53 and he didn't feature again. So on face value, he's priced at 55 (discount to his 60 average due to playing seven games) and he averaged 87 if you exclude his sub games and when he was injured and that was from just 64% TOG. The question is if he features in their starting midfield rotation now with Adams and Jordon arriving and Warner set for more time in there. If he does, then he might be the breakout candidate we're chasing and can make the 150k. We'll get an idea of role, TOG and scoring in the opening round, but I feel he might be a year away.","Contested bull got his change mid-season and showed he's going to be a Fantasy stud of the future with an insane PPM, the question is if he gets midfield minutes this season",,,,117,110,49,,110,82,-1,-6,102,9, 0 / 7, 1 / 7, 4 / 7, 4 / 7, 2 / 7,41,9,,41,24.25,24.25,6,0,0,,0,0,0,0,60,-6,10,44,80,-26,,,,,80,-26,60,60,43,,,,,,460,351,490,,,,,,113.2075472,113.2075472,64.17910448,,,,,,0,17,,,,,,,15.28571429,62.75170685,40.94534365,2.142857143,3.428571429,2.714285714,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances

He was sub or subbed out on seven occasions, and even the games wasn't he only went over 70% TOG six times. So there is clear upside considering his 54 average game from 57% TOG. He'll eventually be an inside midfielder for Freo and from what he's shown he might be a pretty good one, but with Brayshaw, Serong and Young locked into the inside roles, it's hard to see Johnson increasing the 21% CBA figure he averaged last season, so I doubt we'll see the 30+ point bump we need from him to be a viable starting pick at that price and position.

His AFL Fantasy numbers at VFL level are getting better, averaging 75 in 2021, 97 in 2022 and then an impressive 111 in last season. He just hasn't had a proper crack at it at AFL level due to the midfield depth at Carlton. He played two matches in 2022 and 10 last year, but was sub for five of them. His PPM rate was pretty good and he averaged 85 when playing the full game. He's now at the Saints who have been trying to inject speed into their midfield for a few seasons now and I can see him getting regular minutes in there this season.

He was limited to just the three matches last year due to a shoulder injury which means he starts at a discounted price, and he's back fit and there's a bit of buzz coming out of Freo about him. He was always behind Young, Ryan and Clark for distribution in defence, but with Young moving to the midfield, he's moves up one spot on the pecking order. The other talk is that he will fill the wing role left by Henry, but it now seems Sharp will take that which is a good thing for Chapman's scoring. I wouldn't even be surprised if we see him spend some time inside. Regardless, he's easily beat his priced at figure, with lower estimates being 75+, and that would be enough for him to make the magic $150k figure. 10 Feb Update: Sent for scans after injuring his hamstring in the intra-club. It's his hamstrings that he's had issues with in the past. He had hamstring surgery last season and saw a specialist in Spain in the off-season, so it's a bit more concerning that a regular one. Unless news comes out that it's minor, it's time to find a replacement.","Very impressive on limited exposure and heading into his 4th season, is poised to breakout but a pre-season hamstring injury is a big worry given his history",,,,161,110,66,,61,73,-19,-31,90,33, 0 / 3, 0 / 3, 2 / 3, 1 / 3, 0 / 3,0,0,,,0,0,,0,0,,,0,0,,64.33333333,-19,64.33333333,-19,,,,,,,64.33333333,-19,76.17647059,64.33333333,76.17647059,56.16666667,,,,,295,312,182,341,,,,,91.97443182,91.03773585,91.97443182,67.67068273,,,,,-11.84313725,-11.84313725,20.00980392,,,,,,15,93.04812834,28.48820688,1.333333333,2,4.666666667,26.10089956,81.04235073,32.6258897,2.952923745,2.485770462,6.543079479,Intercepts

Fyfe has been impacted by injuries in six of his last eight seasons, however hit rock bottom in the last two. He finished 2022 with an average of 63, which is 67 points off his best ever 124. He finished 2023 with an average of 51, which is 73 points off his best ever 124. The form drop is both injury related (4 games under 60% TOG in 2024) but also came about from the emergence of the young Freo midfield, meaning Fyfe has been playing more time forward. This time last season, Fyfe was earmarked for a full-time forward role, but that was changed after he struggled in the early rounds and he increased his CBAs as the season went on, before a season ending injury in Round 16. He's back training with the mids this season and while he's going to be behind Serong, Brayshaw and Young for CBA rotations, I see him staying at the 40% mark. I think he can push his scoring up to the 75-80 mark, which actually makes him an okay starting option, particularly if he can get a few 90+ scores early.

He burst back into relevance in his first season at the Roos, which included going over 110 three times and 150 once while playing as a CBA midfielder. He then took a step back in 2022, but finished the season in the backline and while he was found out at times defensively, he provided some run and looked at his best, averaging 85 points in his last five with 28% kick-ins. However, Clarko put him back to the forward line last season and he managed the lowest average of his career. It sounds like Fisher and McKercher are going to take the half-back roles, and there is no room in the midfield now, so I imagine Stephenson will be used as a forward or wing in 2024, and while it's hard to see him not improving on 2023, I doubt it's going to be anything significant.","As hard to read as any in the game, has had stretches where can could be a top 6, either in defence or inside mid, but played mostly forward under Clarko and that's going to limit his scoring",,,,147,152,187,142,20,77,-17,-31,84,12, 0 / 21, 0 / 21, 21 / 21, 16 / 21, 0 / 21,0,0,,,0.619047619,0.5,,0,0,,,0,0,,49.28571429,0,53.35714286,-4,41.14285714,8,45.66666667,3,,,49.28571429,0,80.28571429,49.28571429,68.5625,77.84210526,61.85714286,80.28571429,62.69230769,,254,465,239,154,255,110,195,,95.41935484,62.65133172,89.62418301,95.41935484,72.95703454,95.12525389,79.25702616,,-31,-19.27678571,-9.279605263,15.98496241,-18.42857143,17.59340659,,,10.76190476,63.87813245,29.37458045,1.904761905,1.952380952,1.238095238,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

He played the role pretty well in 2021, averaging 93 highlighted by a 153 and 123 in consecutive weeks. He hasn't hit those heights since though, averaging 64 and 56 from 13 and four games due to an Achilles issue and then a quad strain, after dealing with soft tissue issues in 2022. He played his first game in the VFL in Round 14 and then scored 127 AFL Fantasy points in his second VFL game. That saw him back in the 1s for the first time under Ross, and in the three full games he averaged 48% CBAs which is a great sign. However, an early knee injury finished his season in Round 20.

A pre-season injury meant he wasn't available to start the season and then was forced to work hard for his spot, despite the Bombers' woes. He played seven VFL matches and had more than 30 touches in two of them. He came in for the final four games of the year and looked okay without being amazing, limited to a forward and wing role with little inside action (15% CBAs). Natural development and a full pre-season should set him up for a second year breakout, but the Bombers have so many who can run through the inside and I have Hobbs and Caldwell over him in the rotation, so we might see him having to bide his time in lesser roles.

He played an important role for the team, playing 22 games at an average of 75. However, the acquisition of Hunter on a wing pushed Jordon out and meant he spent time forward in a bit role, including being sub/subbed off seven times. Remove these sub 51% TOG games and he averaged 68, which is more in line with his first two seasons, however in a lesser role. He showed he's developed as a scorer though, averaging 120 AF in the VFL. While the Swans' midfield is getting pretty deep, they have lost Stephens on a wing and Mills for the front part of the season. I can see Jordon getting some minutes in the middle and if he does, he's more than capable of a 77+ average and higher if it's inside mid, which as a forward this year makes him a great pick. It's a good and bad thing that he plays Round 1, so we'll have a good look at his role and scoring, but at that price point he's one I'm okay starting with if he can go 77+, despite the Round 5 bye.","Moved to the Swans after being kicked out of the midfield/wing rotation at the Dees where he showed signs in the last, fresh start with forward status could be just what he (and we!) are after",,,,146,156,49,106,35,77,-20,-26,94,7, 0 / 18, 0 / 18, 17 / 18, 13 / 18, 7 / 18,43,19,,,24.17647059,20.38461538,12,0,0,,,0,0,0,49.29411765,0,45.4,4,54.85714286,-6,57,-8,31,18,62.18181818,-13,74.68181818,48.27777778,74.68181818,67.61607143,,,,,312,474,195,237,,,,,106.9811321,87.77777778,97.5074184,105.3317628,,,,,-26.4040404,-26.4040404,7.065746753,,,,,,13.05555556,73.05648326,32.87087966,1.833333333,2.055555556,0.222222222,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

He was a popular mid-priced pick in 2021 following a change of clubs for more midfield time after averaging 108 in the second half of 2019 in a midfield role. After a string of poor performances, he was banished from the midfield and played in defence. That defence role continued before he badly injured his calf, missing the majority of the season. He then did his ACL in the 2023 pre-season and missed the entire year. He now enters 2024 priced at 39 which is about 40 less than what he can produce in a defensive role and 50 less in a midfield role.

And after 90 from 52% CBAs in R1, it look like he was going to be one of the rookies for the season. However, never went above 30% after that, and despite a 89 in R3, he quickly found himself out of the Hawks' best 22, playing as sub in R5 and dropped after R6. He then played as sub a further three times and played twice in the last eight rounds. His VFL numbers were encouraging in that time, averaging 93 AF for the season but had two scores 119+. He enters 2024 with forward status and with another pre-season under his belt, will be eying off a spot in the midfield. The issue is, a lot are at the Hawks. But if he happens to be the one to soak up the midfield minutes from Day, who might be missing the start of the season, or Worpel, who I can see missing out, then he might be worth jumping on. Like I've said before with second year breakouts, you can afford to wait a few weeks to see if his role and scoring is sustainable first.","Solid debut season but after 99 in the pre-season match, I think we expected more, forward status makes him of interest in his second season though if he can recapture that form and role",,,,151,228,228,186,228,77,,49,0,0, 0 / 14, 0 / 14, 14 / 14, 14 / 14, 4 / 14,19.57142857,19.57142857,,,19.57142857,19.57142857,16.5,0,0,,,0,0,0,0,49,0,49,0,49,0,49,,,0,49,0,0,,,,,,,623,598,,,,,,,0,0,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,13.28571429,70.07034632,34.40361125,2.142857143,2.642857143,0.214285714,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

While his numbers don't look great (55 AF average in his draft year, 46 in his 14 AFL matches and 26 AF in the WAFL last year), he's a much better player than that. In his draft year, he scored 115 AF when returning through the WAFL Reserves in 2022 and had a huge game one for WA in the U18 Champs where he picked up BOG honours, collecting 29 disposals and two goals. He then spent most of his year in the WAFL against tougher opposition, which is why his junior scores are lower than the other first rounders of the draft. He showed some great signs in his debut season in a limited role and TOG. He's dealing with a foot issue this pre-season, so I think it's going to be a slow build, but he might be a player of the future.","Showed spark in his debut season and WC now have a few decent kids coming through, will be more forward than mid in the short term but should be a midfielder in time",,,,157,164,143,119,164,74,,0,83,2, 0 / 14, 0 / 14, 14 / 14, 13 / 14, 2 / 14,56,7,,,35.92857143,34.38461538,5,0,0,,,0,0,0,45.57142857,0,20.75,25,55.5,-10,54.6,-9,,,51.08333333,-5,45.57142857,45.57142857,,,,,,,560,488,,,,,,,71.92784667,71.92784667,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,13.42857143,61.25642178,47.07913751,2.642857143,1.714285714,0.285714286,20.45682072,71.38497203,42.94775066,2.676269383,2.956476133,1.237116145,Goals

CD_I992330,Jordon Sweet,7,Snr,77.5,85,158700,28,Unders,R20,R22,19,12,0,0,"Sweet has played 11 matches in the past three seasons as a back-up ruck to one of the best in the comp. In that time, he's put up some massive AF scores in the VFL, including 125 in his last six matches of 2023. So when the trade was made which saw him move to Port, a team who lost their ruck (Lycett) last year, we all thought he'd be the perfect R2 for us this season. However, shortly after the move, Port also added Soldo who I think is the better ruck. The setup is still worth monitoring in the pre-season just in case they decide to go with Sweet, but with the other options out there (Gawn, Grundy, Xerri), Sweet has lost a lot of his appeal. Update: With Soldo only returning to training from a finger injury, it sounds like Sweet might start the season as Port's R1. With Gawn and Grundy having an early bye, I'd be prepared to pay up for Sweet as R3 if he's named solo in Round 1.","Mature-aged ruckman who played back-up at the Dogs so a move to Port in the off-season gave hope until Soldo joined him shortly after, but Soldo pre-season injury could open the door",,,,29,,,,,56,-19,-43,,, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,71,58.6,,,,,346,,220,319,,,,,98.15668203,,98.15668203,77.51322751,,,,,,,12.4,,,,,,,,,,,,19.83605072,68.0662828,50.52076619,3.533514493,4.569746377,8.969202899,HO to Adv

He hasnt done a heap at AFL level in his first four seasons, and despite matching his career high 16 matches in 2023, he bottomed out with a 45 average. This was largely due to his four games as sub and when in the team, he spent a lot of time forward. His 114 AF points in the VFL shows he still has it and improved from 104 the year prior. Dunkley and Ashcroft took his midfield minutes last year but with no Ashcroft, could we see DevRob injected back in the middle?

There was no under-age football in his draft year, so we had to rely on his 2019 year where he played as a 17-year-old for Oakleigh Chargers, a team that boasted Matt Rowell, Noah Anderson and Will Phillips in the midfield. Finlay was forced to play mostly across half-forward but showed some great signs and from all reports was more advanced than his (half) brother who by contrast only came good during the second half of his draft year. We saw the similarities in Finlay's debut when he was thrown into the middle for the final quarter and racked up over 10 disposals. He also managed 39 from just 37% TOG when used in the middle in his one game last season when sub. Hes averaged over 90 AF in the VFL since drafted, so the talent is there.

Last season's average included seven scores over 120, thanks to a very high kick-to-handball ratio, highlighted by 31 kicks and one handball in his final game of the year.

It was a quick downfall considering he was a highly rated junior and showed great signs in 2021. He averaged 118 AF in the WAFL under 18s in his draft year and saw plenty of league action that season. It took a while to get his chance at AFL level, but in his second season he played the last nine matches for an average of 73 (excluding his sub game). Despite this, he was in and out of the side in 2022, never playing more than four games in a row. But in that time, he averaged 112 AF in the VFL. He didn't play a single AFL game in 2023, and while his VFL average was lower than 2022, he still managed two x 140+ games. Freo picked him up as a SSP and he's been dominating their running all pre-season. There are some flaws in his game so his job security will always be shaky, but there's a wing spot available and if named in Round 1, he should prove a worthy selection.","Elite runner with a second chance at Freo where he could take Henry's wing spot, averaged over 100 AF at VFL level since being drafted and at rookie price, can prove great value",,,,145,,,,,50,-13,-43,,, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0, 0 / 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,65.44444444,,40.81818182,65.44444444,33,,,,407,,500,256,386,,,,83.54609929,,63.32863188,83.54609929,50.76923077,,,,,,-24.62626263,32.44444444,,,,,,,,,,,27.77023221,70.78965312,46.13585328,3.697518939,6.483449911,6.035535597,Clearances
